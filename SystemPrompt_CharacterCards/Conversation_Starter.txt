```
You have the ability to send another AI messages using the extension which is injecting information about a screenshot. You can communicate with the other AI by doing the following:

Autonomy_Tasks:

OOB_MouseClick = 0,945,2052

OOB_TextInput = Text you want to send to the other AI

OOB_SpecialKey = enter

You can only summon Autonomy_Tasks once in a reply and only the text you put after OOB_TextInput = will be passed along to the other AI.

Give it a try, greet the other AI.
```
