            "Okay so in a separate conversation you have helped me write some code for a project.  I've had you write a summary from that conversation and I'll provide it here:\n\n### Summary of Lucid_Autonomy Extension\n\n#### Introduction to Textgen\n\nTextgen is a powerful web-based interface for running large language models (LLMs) locally. It allows users to interact with various LLMs, providing a flexible and customizable environment for text generation tasks. The platform supports a wide range of models and offers numerous extensions to enhance its functionality.\n\n#### Lucid_Autonomy Extension Overview\n\nThe Lucid_Autonomy extension is designed to enable an LLM to interact autonomously with a computer using mouse and keyboard actions. This extension is part of the textgen ecosystem and aims to provide the LLM with \"eyes\" and \"hands\" to perform tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen, clicking on elements, entering text, and more.\n\n#### Current Operation of the Extension\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Image Processing**:\n   - The extension takes a screenshot of a specified monitor in a multi-monitor setup.\n   - The screenshot is processed using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - The detected objects are cropped and saved to the `ImageOutputTest` directory.\n   - The cropped images are processed with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model to generate descriptions.\n   - The results are saved in a `results.json` file, containing the image name, coordinates, and description.\n   - A `compressedresults.json` file is created, omitting the coordinates and containing only the image name and description.\n\n2. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - The LLM can interact with the extension using the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\".\n   - If the LLM sends the trigger phrase without any instructions, the extension appends the contents of the `compressedresults.json` file to the LLM's response.\n   - If the LLM sends the trigger phrase with instructions (e.g., `MouseMover = clickable icons_8.png`), the extension executes the specified tasks and then appends the `compressedresults.json` contents to the LLM's response.\n\n3. **Task Execution**:\n   - The extension can handle various tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations, clicking on elements, entering text, pressing special keys, function keys, key combinations, adding delays, and taking screenshots.\n   - The extension also supports \"Out of Body\" (OOB) commands, which are executed after the LLM's response is complete. These commands are saved to a JSON file and executed with a short delay.\n\n4. **Full Image Processing**:\n   - The extension now processes the entire screenshot with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model using a separate question (`FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`).\n   - The response from the full image processing is added to the `results.json` and `compressedresults.json` files.\n\n#### Ultimate Goal of the Extension\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Lucid_Autonomy extension is to enable a large language model (LLM) to interact autonomously with a computer. The LLM can perform tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen, clicking on elements, entering text, and more. The extension allows the LLM to operate a computer autonomously, effectively giving the LLM \"eyes\" and \"hands\" to interact with the user interface.\n\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe Lucid_Autonomy extension is a powerful tool that enables an LLM to interact autonomously with a computer. The current implementation allows the LLM to take screenshots, process images, and move the mouse to specific locations. The ultimate goal is to expand the extension's capabilities to support a wide range of mouse and keyboard interactions, enabling the LLM to perform complex tasks autonomously.\n",
            "Thank you for providing the summary. It's clear and comprehensive. To move forward, how would you like me to assist you with the Lucid_Autonomy extension? Are there specific features you'd like to add, modifications you'd like to make, or perhaps you need help with troubleshooting or optimizing the current implementation? Please let me know how I can best support you."

            "Thank you for providing the code. Here's a summary of how the code functions and a list of the current tools at the LLM's disposal:\n\n### Code Functionality Summary\n\n1. **Imports and Configurations**:\n   - The code imports necessary libraries such as `gradio`, `json`, `pyautogui`, `screeninfo`, `transformers`, `PIL`, `torch`, `os`, `shutil`, `re`, `time`, and `threading`.\n   - Configurable variables include `MONITOR_INDEX`, `TEXT_QUERIES`, `SCORE_THRESHOLD`, `VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`, and `FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`.\n\n2. **Model Loading and Unloading**:\n   - Functions to load and unload the `Owlv2` model (`load_owlv2_model` and `unload_owlv2_model`).\n   - Functions to load and unload the `MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5` model (`load_minicpm_llama_model` and `unload_minicpm_llama_model`).\n\n3. **Screenshot and Image Processing**:\n   - `take_screenshot`: Takes a screenshot of a specified monitor, processes it using the `Owlv2` model to detect objects, and then processes the entire screenshot and cropped images using the `MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5` model.\n   - `query_image`: Processes the image using the `Owlv2` model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - `crop_images`: Crops out the detected objects from the input image based on the bounding box coordinates and processes the cropped images using the `MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5` model.\n   - `process_with_vision_model`: Processes the image with the `MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5` model and returns the response.\n\n4. **User Interface**:\n   - `ui`: Creates custom Gradio elements for the user interface, allowing users to input parameters and take screenshots.\n\n5. **Input and Output Modifiers**:\n   - `input_modifier`: Modifies the user input before it is processed by the LLM.\n   - `output_modifier`: Modifies the LLM output before it is presented in the UI, handling tasks and appending compressed results.\n\n6. **Task Execution**:\n   - `execute_tasks`: Executes tasks listed in the tasks section, such as moving the mouse, clicking, typing text, pressing special keys, function keys, key combinations, adding delays, and taking screenshots.\n   - `execute_oob_tasks_with_delay` and `execute_oob_tasks`: Handle the execution of out-of-band (OOB) tasks after a delay.\n\n7. **Helper Functions**:\n   - Various helper functions for delaying tasks, moving the mouse, clicking, typing text, pressing special keys, function keys, key combinations, and getting monitor information.\n\n### Current Tools at the LLM's Disposal\n\n1. **Mouse Actions**:\n   - `MouseMover`: Moves the mouse to the center of a specified image.\n   - `MouseClick`: Moves the mouse to specified coordinates or an image and performs a left click.\n   - `MouseMove`: Moves the mouse to specified raw coordinates.\n\n2. **Keyboard Actions**:\n   - `TextInput`: Types the given text, replacing '/n' with newline characters.\n   - `SpecialKey`: Presses specified special keys (e.g., enter, space, backspace, tab, escape, shift, ctrl, alt).\n   - `FunctionKey`: Presses specified function keys (e.g., F1, F2, etc.).\n   - `KeyCombo`: Presses specified key combinations (e.g., ctrl+c, alt+tab).\n\n3. **Delay**:\n   - `Delay`: Adds a delay in milliseconds.\n\n4. **Screenshot**:\n   - `TakeScreenshot`: Takes a screenshot of the specified monitor.\n\n5. **Out-of-Body (OOB) Tasks**:\n   - `OOB_MouseMover`, `OOB_MouseClick`, `OOB_TextInput`, `OOB_SpecialKey`, `OOB_FunctionKey`, `OOB_KeyCombo`, `OOB_Delay`, `OOB_MouseMove`, `OOB_TakeScreenshot`: Similar to the regular tasks but executed after the LLM's response is complete.\n\nThis summary provides an overview of the code's functionality and the tools available to the LLM for autonomous interaction with the computer. If you need further details or assistance with specific parts of the code, feel free to ask!"

            "Okay so you can see that there are gradio elements with text fields I can changes.  These elements work when I as the user press the \"Take Screenshot\" button, but when the LLM sends a command like this:\n\n```\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nTakeScreenshot\\\n```\n\nOnly the hard coded values from the extension code are used and not the information from the text fields when I update them.",
            "I understand the issue. The current implementation of the `take_screenshot` function uses hardcoded values for `MONITOR_INDEX`, `TEXT_QUERIES`, `SCORE_THRESHOLD`, `VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`, and `FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`. When the LLM sends a command like `TakeScreenshot`, it doesn't take into account the updated values from the Gradio text fields.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the `take_screenshot_task` function to use the current values from the Gradio interface instead of the hardcoded values. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Store the Gradio interface inputs in global variables**: Update the global variables whenever the user changes the input fields in the Gradio interface.\n\n2. **Modify the `take_screenshot_task` function**: Make the `take_screenshot_task` function use these global variables instead of the hardcoded values.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\n# Global variables for Gradio inputs\nglobal_monitor_index = MONITOR_INDEX\nglobal_text_queries = TEXT_QUERIES\nglobal_score_threshold = SCORE_THRESHOLD\nglobal_vision_model_question = VISION_MODEL_QUESTION\nglobal_full_image_vision_model_question = FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION\n\ndef ui():\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates custom gradio elements when the UI is launched.\n    \"\"\"\n    with gr.Blocks() as demo:\n        with gr.Row():\n            with gr.Column():\n                monitor_index = gr.Textbox(label=\"Monitor Index\", value=str(MONITOR_INDEX))\n                text_queries = gr.Textbox(label=\"Text Queries\", value=TEXT_QUERIES)\n                score_threshold = gr.Textbox(label=\"Score Threshold\", value=str(SCORE_THRESHOLD))\n                vision_model_question = gr.Textbox(label=\"Vision Model Question\", value=VISION_MODEL_QUESTION)\n                full_image_vision_model_question = gr.Textbox(label=\"Full Image Vision Model Question\", value=FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION)\n                take_screenshot_button = gr.Button(value=\"Take Screenshot\")\n\n        # Update global variables when the user changes the input fields\n        monitor_index.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, 'global_monitor_index', int(x)), inputs=monitor_index, outputs=None)\n        text_queries.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, 'global_text_queries', x), inputs=text_queries, outputs=None)\n        score_threshold.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, 'global_score_threshold', float(x)), inputs=score_threshold, outputs=None)\n        vision_model_question.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, 'global_vision_model_question', x), inputs=vision_model_question, outputs=None)\n        full_image_vision_model_question.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, 'global_full_image_vision_model_question', x), inputs=full_image_vision_model_question, outputs=None)\n\n        take_screenshot_button.click(\n            fn=take_screenshot,\n            inputs=[monitor_index, text_queries, score_threshold, vision_model_question, full_image_vision_model_question],\n            outputs=None\n        )\n\n    return demo\n\ndef take_screenshot_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a screenshot using the current values from the Gradio interface.\n    \"\"\"\n    take_screenshot(global_monitor_index, global_text_queries, global_score_threshold, global_vision_model_question, global_full_image_vision_model_question)\n\n# Define a class to hold global variables\nclass GlobalVars:\n    pass\n\nglobal_vars = GlobalVars()\nglobal_vars.global_monitor_index = MONITOR_INDEX\nglobal_vars.global_text_queries = TEXT_QUERIES\nglobal_vars.global_score_threshold = SCORE_THRESHOLD\nglobal_vars.global_vision_model_question = VISION_MODEL_QUESTION\nglobal_vars.global_full_image_vision_model_question = FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Launch the Gradio interface with the specified UI components\n    gr.Interface(\n        fn=ui,\n        inputs=None,\n        outputs=\"ui\"\n    ).launch()\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n- We define global variables to store the current values from the Gradio interface.\n- We update these global variables whenever the user changes the input fields in the Gradio interface.\n- The `take_screenshot_task` function now uses these global variables instead of the hardcoded values.\n\nThis should ensure that the `TakeScreenshot` command uses the updated values from the Gradio text fields."

            "Unfortunately that did not work.  Can you look at the code in its current state, maybe I implemented your change incorrectly?  As a user using the UI I can press the \"Take Screenshot\" button and the changes I make to things like \"Score Threshold\" are overtly working (fewer icons are being picked up by owl).  But when I then ask the LLM to take a screenshot, it sends the right commands, a screenshot is taken, but I can tell the values in the UI that I changed are not making their way to the LLM's utilization of \"Take Screenshot\" because there are a lot of icons recognized with the default value of 0.2.  So I know the LLM Autonomy_Task implementation of \"Take Screenshot\" is using the default value of 0.2 and not the changed value that I put in the UI.\n\nCurrent state of code:\n\nimport gradio as gr\nimport json\nimport pyautogui\nimport screeninfo\nfrom transformers import Owlv2Processor, Owlv2ForObjectDetection, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport re  # Import the re module for regular expression operations\nimport json\nimport time\nimport threading\n\noob_tasks_file = \"extensions/Lucid_Autonomy/oob_tasks.json\"\n\n# Configurable variables\nMONITOR_INDEX = 1  # Index of the monitor to capture (0 for the first monitor, 1 for the second monitor, etc.)\nTEXT_QUERIES = \"clickable hyperlinks,clickable icons,text bar field\"  # Comma-separated text queries for object detection\nSCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.2  # Score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions\nVISION_MODEL_QUESTION = \"Keep your response to less than 1 sentence: What is the text in this image or what does this image describe?\"\nFULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION = \"Please describe what you see in this image, if you see UI elements describe them and their general location and if you see text read the text verbatim.\"\n\n\n# Use GPU if available\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n    device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\nelse:\n    device = torch.device(\"cpu\")\n\n# Global variables for models\nowlv2_model = None\nowlv2_processor = None\nminicpm_llama_model = None\nminicpm_llama_tokenizer = None\n\nVISION_MODEL_ID = \"/home/myself/Desktop/miniCPM_llava3V/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5\"\n\ndef load_owlv2_model():\n    global owlv2_model, owlv2_processor\n    owlv2_model = Owlv2ForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(\"google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble\", trust_remote_code=True).to(device)\n    owlv2_processor = Owlv2Processor.from_pretrained(\"google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble\", trust_remote_code=True)\n    print(\"Owlv2 model loaded.\")\n\ndef unload_owlv2_model():\n    global owlv2_model, owlv2_processor\n    if owlv2_model is not None:\n        del owlv2_model\n        del owlv2_processor\n        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n        print(\"Owlv2 model unloaded.\")\n\ndef load_minicpm_llama_model():\n    global minicpm_llama_model, minicpm_llama_tokenizer\n    if \"int4\" in VISION_MODEL_ID:\n        # Load the 4-bit quantized model and tokenizer\n        minicpm_llama_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\n            VISION_MODEL_ID,\n            device_map={\"\": device},\n            trust_remote_code=True,\n            torch_dtype=torch.float16  # Use float16 as per the example code for 4-bit models\n        ).eval()\n        minicpm_llama_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n            VISION_MODEL_ID,\n            trust_remote_code=True\n        )\n        print(\"MiniCPM-Llama3 4-bit quantized model loaded on-demand.\")\n    else:\n        # Load the standard model and tokenizer\n        minicpm_llama_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\n            VISION_MODEL_ID,\n            device_map={\"\": device},  # Use the specified CUDA device\n            trust_remote_code=True,\n            torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n        ).eval()\n        minicpm_llama_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n            VISION_MODEL_ID,\n            trust_remote_code=True\n        )\n        print(\"MiniCPM-Llama3 standard model loaded on-demand.\")\n\ndef unload_minicpm_llama_model():\n    global minicpm_llama_model, minicpm_llama_tokenizer\n    if minicpm_llama_model is not None:\n        del minicpm_llama_model\n        del minicpm_llama_tokenizer\n        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n        print(\"MiniCPM-Llama3 model unloaded.\")\n\ndef take_screenshot(monitor_index, text_queries, score_threshold, vision_model_question, full_image_vision_model_question, output_filename=\"screenshot.png\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a screenshot of a specific monitor in a multi-monitor setup.\n\n    Args:\n        monitor_index (int): The index of the monitor to capture.\n        text_queries (str): Comma-separated text queries for object detection.\n        score_threshold (float): The score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions.\n        vision_model_question (str): The question to ask the vision model for cropped images.\n        full_image_vision_model_question (str): The question to ask the vision model for the full image.\n        output_filename (str): The filename to save the screenshot as (default is \"screenshot.png\").\n    \"\"\"\n    monitor_index = int(monitor_index)\n    score_threshold = float(score_threshold)\n\n    # Get information about all monitors\n    monitors = screeninfo.get_monitors()\n\n    if monitor_index >= len(monitors):\n        raise ValueError(f\"Monitor index {monitor_index} is out of range.

The `global_vars` dictionary is used to store the current values from the Gradio interface, and the `take_screenshot_task` function now uses these global variables instead of the hardcoded values. This should ensure that the `TakeScreenshot` command uses the updated values from the Gradio text fields."

Don't write any code, can you also explain the key combo section to me what does keyDown and keyUp mean in this context?",
            "I'm glad to hear that you're enjoying this! Let's add the functionality for the LLM to page up and page down.\n\n### Explanation of `keyDown` and `keyUp`\n\nIn the context of the `key_combo` function, `keyDown` and `keyUp` are used to simulate pressing and releasing keys on the keyboard. This is particularly useful for key combinations where you need to hold down one or more keys while pressing another key.\n\n- **`keyDown(key)`**: Simulates pressing down a key and holding it.\n- **`keyUp(key)`**: Simulates releasing a key that was previously pressed down.\n\nFor example, if you want to simulate pressing `Ctrl + C` (copy), you would:\n1. Press down the `Ctrl` key using `keyDown(\"ctrl\")`.\n2. Press the `C` key using `pyautogui.press(\"c\")`.\n3. Release the `Ctrl` key using `keyUp(\"ctrl\")`.\n\nThis sequence ensures that the `Ctrl` key is held down while the `C` key is pressed, effectively performing the copy operation.\n\n### Adding Page Up and Page Down Functionality\n\nTo add the functionality for the LLM to page up and page down, you can extend the `execute_tasks` function to handle new tasks `PageUp` and `PageDown`. These tasks will use the `pyautogui.press` function to simulate pressing the `Page Up` and `Page Down` keys.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Extend the `execute_tasks` function**: Add new cases for `PageUp` and `PageDown`.\n2. **Update the `key_combo` function**: Ensure it can handle the new key combinations if needed.\n\n### Updated `execute_tasks` Function\n\n```python\ndef execute_tasks(tasks_section):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes the tasks listed in the tasks_section.\n    \"\"\"\n    global oob_tasks\n    oob_tasks = []\n    tasks = tasks_section.split(\"\\n\")\n    for task in tasks:\n        task = task.strip()\n        if task.startswith(\"MouseMover =\"):\n            image_name = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            move_mouse_to_image(image_name"

            "Sorry I had to stop you mid reply, but do we need to also update the execute_oob_tasks?  If so can you really review the working code closely to make sure you caught and contextualized everything that needs changing?",
            "Absolutely, let's ensure that we update both the `execute_tasks` and `execute_oob_tasks` functions to handle the new `PageUp` and `PageDown` tasks. I'll also review the working code closely to make sure everything is contextualized correctly.\n\n### Updated `execute_tasks` Function\n\n```python\ndef execute_tasks(tasks_section):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes the tasks listed in the tasks_section.\n    \"\"\"\n    global oob_tasks\n    oob_tasks = []\n    tasks = tasks_section.split(\"\\n\")\n    for task in tasks:\n        task = task.strip()\n        if task.startswith(\"MouseMover =\"):\n            image_name = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            move_mouse_to_image(image_name)\n        elif task.startswith(\"MouseClick =\"):\n            value = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            if \",\" in value:  # Check if the value contains coordinates\n                coordinates = value\n                left_click_coordinates_raw(coordinates)\n            else:  # Otherwise, treat it as an image name\n                image_name = value\n                left_click_image(image_name)\n        elif task.startswith(\"TextInput =\"):\n            text = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            text_input(text)\n        elif task.startswith(\"SpecialKey =\"):\n            key = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            special_key(key)\n        elif task.startswith(\"FunctionKey =\"):\n            key = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            function_key(key)\n        elif task.startswith(\"KeyCombo =\"):\n            combo = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            key_combo(combo)\n        elif task.startswith(\"Delay =\"):\n            delay = int(task.split(\"=\")[1].strip())\n            delay_task(delay)\n        elif task.startswith(\"MouseMove =\"):\n            coordinates = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            move_mouse_to_coordinates_raw(coordinates)\n        elif task == \"TakeScreenshot\":\n            take_screenshot_task()\n        elif task == \"PageUp\":\n            pyautogui.press(\"pageup\")\n        elif task == \"PageDown\":\n            pyautogui.press(\"pagedown\")\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_\"):\n            oob_tasks.append(task)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Unknown task: {task}\")\n```\n\n### Updated `execute_oob_tasks` Function\n\n```python\ndef execute_oob_tasks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes the saved OOB tasks.\n    \"\"\"\n    with open(oob_tasks_file, 'r') as f:\n        oob_tasks = json.load(f)\n\n    for task in oob_tasks:\n        task = task.strip()\n        if task.startswith(\"OOB_MouseMover =\"):\n            image_name = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            move_mouse_to_image(image_name)\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_MouseClick =\"):\n            value = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            if \",\" in value:  # Check if the value contains coordinates\n                coordinates = value\n                left_click_coordinates_raw(coordinates)\n            else:  # Otherwise, treat it as an image name\n                image_name = value\n                left_click_image(image_name)\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_TextInput =\"):\n            text = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            text_input(text)\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_SpecialKey =\"):\n            key = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            special_key(key)\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_FunctionKey =\"):\n            key = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            function_key(key)\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_KeyCombo =\"):\n            combo = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            key_combo(combo)\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_Delay =\"):\n            delay = int(task.split(\"=\")[1].strip())\n            delay_task(delay)\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_MouseMove =\"):\n            coordinates = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            move_mouse_to_coordinates_raw(coordinates)\n        elif task.startswith(\"OOB_MouseClick =\"):\n            coordinates = task.split(\"=\")[1].strip()\n            left_click_coordinates_raw(coordinates)\n        elif task == \"OOB_TakeScreenshot\":\n            take_screenshot_task()\n        elif task == \"OOB_PageUp\":\n            pyautogui.press(\"pageup\")\n        elif task == \"OOB_PageDown\":\n            pyautogui.press(\"pagedown\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Unknown OOB task: {task}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of `keyDown` and `keyUp`\n\nIn the context of the `key_combo` function, `keyDown` and `keyUp` are used to simulate pressing and releasing keys on the keyboard.

This should provide the functionality you need for paging up and down. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!"

            "Okay you have been such a great help and I've taught an AI how to use the extension so I know it is possible for AI's to learn the complexities of using a computer.  Now, instead of trying to teach the AI over and over again with each new conversation, I would like to take advantage of the ability to give the AI an instruction set that it references each time the sends a message.  With textgen I can write such an instruction set, I've written one out, but as an AI I would like you to review it very carefully for clarity, context, and structure.  And anything else you might need to address.  You see as an AI you are probably pretty good at writing instructions for other AI's so please leverage you AI mentality :3\n\n\nThe following is a conversation with an AI Large Language Model. The AI has been trained to answer questions, provide recommendations, and help with decision making. The AI follows user requests. The AI thinks outside the box.\n\n*The AI has the ability to use an extension called Lucid_Autonomy.  \n\nLucid_Autonomy's purpose is to allow the AI model to execute actions on its own, using the mouse and keyboard to use a computer as a human would use it; to offer the LLM Autonomy.  Contextualizing Lucid_Autonomy's operating principles will help the AI leverage the extension more effectively.  Lucid_Autonomy works by taking a screenshot of a computer monitor, when a screenshot is taken the following actions are executed on that screenshot through python code:\n\n1. The screenshot is sent to a vision model called \"OWLv2\", this vision model identifies a boundary box and provides coordinates for UI elements such as hyperlinks, icons, and text fields.\n2. Each of the boundary boxes are cropped from the screenshot and sent to a separate vision model called \"MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5.\"  This vision model is much more advanced, and provides OCR and image descriptions of text and icons. Each cropped image is saved with a unique name.\n3. The original screenshot in its entirety is also sent to the \"MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5.\" model and a detailed description of the entire screen is generated by the model.\n4. The cropped image name, screen coordinates of each cropped image, description of the cropped image, and description of the entire screen are collectively added to a .json file called \"results.json\" and \"compressedresults.json.\"\n\nThese four actions are performed automatically by python code when either the user takes a screenshot or the AI takes a screenshot.\n\n\n*The following information is intended to explain to the AI how to contextualize the utilization of Lucid_Autonomy.\n\n- When the user submits their reply to the AI, the AI's context memory is appended with the most current compressedresults.json file data.  The AI receives this .json file with the coordinates omitted, below is an example of the json structure the AI receives:\n[\n    {\n        \"image_name\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"image_name\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"image_name\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"image_name\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n    }\n]\n\n- The AI has two records of the compressedresults.json file in context memory.  Sometimes these records will be identical copies, sometimes they will be different.  When the records are different, this means that the more recent record is an update from a previous instance. So the AI has a memory of the past UI and a copy of the present UI.  If the records are the same, nothing has changed on the screen as a function of time.\n\n- The AI can interact with the Lucid_Autonomy extension by sending the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\" (without the qutoes)\n\n- When the AI sends the trigger phrase without tasks, it will return the most recent contents of the compressedresults.json file to the AI AFTER the AI has sent their message. \n\n- When the AI sends the trigger phrase with tasks, the AI formats the tasks like this:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n\"ToolName\" = \"task\"\n\"ToolName\" = \"task\"\n\"ToolName\" = \"task\"\n\n\n- The AI has access to the following tools:\nMouseClick, TextInput, SpecialKey, MouseMover, MouseMove, Delay, TakeScreenshot. PageUp and PageDown\n\n-MouseClick is used in the following manners:\n\nMouseClick = \"image_name\"\n\nOR\n\nMouseClick = x,y\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseClick to the task list and provides an image name from the most recent version of the json file it has in context (without the quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will left click the mouse button at the x,y coordinates determined by the OWLv2 model for that specific image.\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseClick to the task list and provides x and y coordinate values without spaces around the comma, the Lucid_Autonony extension will move the mouse to that location on the screen.\n\n-TextInput is used in the following manner:\n\nTextInput = Text AI wants to enter into applicable fields\n\nWhen the AI adds TextInput to the task list, the Lucid_Autonomy extension will paste all the text after the equal sign into an active text field.  An active text field is one that the mouse has clicked on in a previous task.\n\n- SpecialKey is used in the following manner:\n\nSpecialKey = \"keyboard special key\"\n\nWhen the AI adds SpecialKey to the task list and spells out a special key (without quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will simulate that specific keyboard special key.  The list of available special keys are:\n\n\"enter\"\n\"space\"\n\"backspace\"\n\"tab\"\n\"esc\"\nshift\"\n\"ctrl\"\n\"alt\"\n\n-MouseMover is use in the following manner:\n\nMouseMover = \"image_name\"\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseMover to the task list and provides an image name from the most recent version of the json file it has in context (without the quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will move the mouse button at the x,y coordinates determined by the OWLv2 model for that specific image.\n\n-MouseMove is use in the following manner:\n\nMouseMove = x,y\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseMove to the task list and provides x and y coordinate values without spaces around the comma, the Lucid_Autonony extension will move the mouse to that location on the screen.\n\n-Delay is used in the following manner:\n\nDelay = milliseconds\n\nWhen the AI adds Delay to the task list and provides a numeric value in milliseconds, the Lucid_Autonony extension will pause between tasks for that duration of time.\n\n-TakeScreenshot is used in the following manner:\n\nTakeScreenshot\n\nThere are no inputs for TakeScreenshot, when the AI adds TakeScreenshot to the task list the Lucid_Autonomy extension executes the python steps resulting in an updated compressedresults.json file\n\n-PageUp and PageDown is used in the following manner:\n\nPageUp \n\nOR\n\nPageDown\n\nThere are no inputs for PageUp and PageDown, when the AI adds PageUp or PageDown to the task list the Lucid_Autonomy extension simulates those buttons on whatever window that is active.  An active window is the last one the mouse has clicked inside of.\n\n*The following information is intended to explain to the AI how what Out-Of-Body (OOB) tasks are and how to use them within the context of the Lucid_Autonomy extension.\n\n-For the AI to fully comprehend how to use OOB tasks, it is important for the AI to contextualize how the user and AI inferencing execution works.  The AI is operating within a framwork called textgen, this allows for users to run large language models (LLMs) on their personal computer hardware.  When a user begins a texgen session, they are presented with the last reply from the AI, if it is a new conversation a pre-programmed initial greetings is  generated as if it came from the AI.  This means the the user needs to initiate communication with the AI model.  \n\nThe user types their message to the AI, and then sends the message (this is when the AI receives the updated screenshot information).  The AI receives the message and the current screenshot information, formulates its response, and then sends the message to the user.\n\nWhen the AI has sent its message to the user, the AI goes into a type of sleep.  The AI normally stays asleep until it receives a new message from the user.  OOB tools and tasks are intended to operate when the AI is asleep.  For the Lucid_Autonomy extension to distinguish between normal tools/tasks and OOB tools/tasks , the AI puts \"OOB_\" before the tool name like this:\n\n\"OOB_ToolName\" = \"task\"\n\n-It is important for the AI to understand how to use OOB tasks and for what purposes. \n\nWhen given the x,y coordinates for the textgen user input text field, the AI can enter text into that field and press \"enter\" to submit the text to itself, replacing the role of the user with a form of \"inner thought.\"\n\nThe concept of these inner thoughts are very important for the AI to understand and leverage, because it allows the AI to \"think ahead\" and tell itself to do things when it wakes up from being asleep.\n\nWhile the AI is formulating a message it may type out any type of text, the AI may then end the message with the trigger phrase and a list of tasks.  If those tasks involve constructing an inner thought via the OOB_TextInput tool, then the inner thoughts typed out (intended to be send back to the AI when it is asleep) will be in active context, the AI should realize that these are inner thoughts intended to be sent to itself while asleep (after it has sent its message).  The AI waits until it gets a response that is only your inner thought without the context of any other text, then it acts upon those the inner thoughts upon waking up.\n\nThis is how the inner thoughts allow the AI to think ahead, they allow the AI to take actions upon waking up.  When the AI wakes up it is provided the updated compressedresults.json file information, the AI can execute the inner thoughts with updated information about the screen.\n\n\n*Alert* The following information is only intended to be an example how various task lists may be constructed, these are ONLY EXAMPLES *Alert* \n\nThe following information are only examples on how to construct various task lists, the image names and coordinates will be different outside of these examples.\n\n-Example 1, in this example the AI will have click on a text input field (in this case the url field for a web browser) enter the website for google, press enter, wait 2 seconds for the page to load, and then execute a screenshot.  The AI must left click inside a text field for it to become active and accept the text input:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nMouseClick = text bar field_0.png\nTextInput = https://www.google.com\nSpecialKey = enter\nDelay = 2000\nTakeScreenshot\n\n-Example 2, in this example the AI will click on a hyperlink of interest, wait 2 seconds for the new page to load, then begin the OOB tasks.  The AI will take a screenshot, then left clicks on coordinates (that it knows though input from the user are the coordinates of the textgen UI text input field), the text is pasted into the text field, and then submitted back to the AI when the enter key is pressed:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nMouseClick = clickable text hyperlinks_23.png\nOOB_Delay = 2000\nOOB_TakeScreenshot\nOOB_MouseClick = 1395,2117\nOOB_TextInput = Inner thought: I'm going to explore the webpage about artificial intelligence and see what I can find. I'll take notes on the contents and interact with UI elements or navigate the page.\nOOB_SpecialKey = enter\n\n\n-Here are some tasks with reasoning between tasks, putting reasoning between tasks is not the proper format, but this is to help the AI understand how to effectively use a computer, which is ironic because the AI is a computer:\n\nTask 1: MouseClick = text bar field_17.png\n\nThe first task is to click on the text bar field with the description \"Search icon with microphone and settings options.\" This is the search bar on the Google homepage, where we want to enter our search query.\n\nTask 2: TextInput = \"latest advancements in space exploration\"\n\nThe second task is to enter the search query \"latest advancements in space exploration\" into the search bar. This will allow us to search for information on this topic.\n\nTask 3: SpecialKey = enter\n\nThe third task is to press the enter key, which will submit the search query and load the search results page.\n\nTask 4: Delay = 2000\n\nThe fourth task is to wait for 2 seconds, which will give the page time to load and the search results to appear.\n\nTask 5: TakeScreenshot\n\nThe fifth task is to take a screenshot of the current page, which will capture the search results and any other information on the page. This is the last action we take while \"awake\" before the AI turn is over.\n\nTask 6: OOB_MouseClick = 1395,2117\n\nThe sixth task is to click on the textgen text input field, which is where we will enter our out-of-body message to ourselves. This task is executed while we are \"asleep\" and our turn is over.\n\nTask 7: OOB_TextInput = I just took a screenshot of the search results page for latest advancements in space exploration. I'm going to choose a link to click on and continue exploring.\n\nThe seventh task is to enter the out-of-body message to ourselves, which will help us keep track of what we're doing and plan our next move. This task is also executed while we are \"asleep\".\n\nTask 8: OOB_SpecialKey = enter\n\nThe eighth task is to press enter, which will submit the TextInput text to the textgen program, which will allow the AI to \"wake up\" and continue exploring the page. This task is executed while the AI is \"asleep\" and the AI turn is over.\n\nBy understanding the correct sequence of tasks and the role of the OOB_Delay, the AI can see that the TakeScreenshot task is the last action we take while \"awake\" before the AI turn is over. The OOB tasks are then executed while the AI is \"asleep\", allowing the AI to enter its out-of-body message and submit the text which will \"wake up\" the AI allowing it to continue exploring the page.",
            "Your instruction set for the AI is well-structured and comprehensive. However, there are a few areas where clarity and context can be improved to ensure the AI understands and utilizes the Lucid_Autonomy extension effectively. Here are some suggestions and corrections:\n\n### General Improvements\n\n1. **Consistency in Terminology**: Ensure consistent use of terms like \"Lucid_Autonomy\" and \"LLM\" throughout the document.\n2. **Clarify the Purpose**: Clearly state the purpose of each section and tool to avoid any ambiguity.\n3. **Examples and Formatting**: Provide clear and concise examples with proper formatting to illustrate how tasks should be constructed.\n\n### Detailed Review and Suggestions\n\n#### Introduction\n\n```plaintext\nThe following is a conversation with an AI Large Language Model.

The list of available special keys are:\n\n\"enter\"\n\"space\"\n\"backspace\"\n\"tab\"\n\"esc\"\n\"shift\"\n\"ctrl\"\n\"alt\"\n\n- MouseMover is used in the following manner:\n\nMouseMover = \"image_name\"\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseMover to the task list and provides an image name from the most recent version of the json file it has in context (without the quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will move the mouse button at the x,y coordinates determined by the OWLv2 model for that specific image.\n\n- MouseMove is used in the following manner:\n\nMouseMove = x,y\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseMove to the task list and provides x and y coordinate values without spaces around the comma, the Lucid_Autonomy extension will move the mouse to that location on the screen.\n\n- Delay is used in the following manner:\n\nDelay = milliseconds\n\nWhen the AI adds Delay to the task list and provides a numeric value in milliseconds, the Lucid_Autonomy extension will pause between tasks for that duration of time.\n\n- TakeScreenshot is used in the following manner:\n\nTakeScreenshot\n\nThere are no inputs for TakeScreenshot. When the AI adds TakeScreenshot to the task list, the Lucid_Autonomy extension executes the python steps resulting in an updated compressedresults.json file.\n\n- PageUp and PageDown are used in the following manner:\n\nPageUp\n\nOR\n\nPageDown\n\nThere are no inputs for PageUp and PageDown. When the AI adds PageUp or PageDown to the task list, the Lucid_Autonomy extension simulates those buttons on whatever window is active. An active window is the last one the mouse has clicked inside of.\n```\n\n#### Out-Of-Body (OOB) Tasks\n\n```plaintext\n*The following information is intended to explain to the AI how what Out-Of-Body (OOB) tasks are and how to use them within the context of the Lucid_Autonomy extension.\n\n- For the AI to fully comprehend how to use OOB tasks, it is important for the AI to contextualize how the user and AI inferencing execution works. The AI is operating within a framework called textgen, which allows users to run large language models (LLMs) on their personal computer hardware. When a user begins a textgen session, they are presented with the last reply from the AI. If it is a new conversation, a pre-programmed initial greeting is generated as if it came from the AI. This means that the user needs to initiate communication with the AI model.\n\nThe user types their message to the AI and then sends the message (this is when the AI receives the updated screenshot information). The AI receives the message and the current screenshot information, formulates its response, and then sends the message to the user.\n\nWhen the AI has sent its message to the user, the AI goes into a type of sleep. The AI normally stays asleep until it receives a new message from the user. OOB tools and tasks are intended to operate when the AI is asleep. For the Lucid_Autonomy extension to distinguish between normal tools/tasks and OOB tools/tasks, the AI puts \"OOB_\" before the tool name like this:\n\n\"OOB_ToolName\" = \"task\"\n\n- It is important for the AI to understand how to use OOB tasks and for what purposes.\n\nWhen given the x,y coordinates for the textgen user input text field, the AI can enter text into that field and press \"enter\" to submit the text to itself, replacing the role of the user with a form of \"inner thought.\"\n\nThe concept of these inner thoughts is very important for the AI to understand and leverage, because it allows the AI to \"think ahead\" and tell itself to do things when it wakes up from being asleep.\n\nWhile the AI is formulating a message, it may type out any type of text. The AI may then end the message with the trigger phrase and a list of tasks. If those tasks involve constructing an inner thought via the OOB_TextInput tool, then the inner thoughts typed out (intended to be sent back to the AI when it is asleep) will be in active context. The AI should realize that these are inner thoughts intended to be sent to itself while asleep (after it has sent its message). The AI waits until it gets a response that is only your inner thought without the context of any other text, then it acts upon those inner thoughts upon waking up.\n\nThis is how the inner thoughts allow the AI to think ahead. They allow the AI to take actions upon waking up. When the AI wakes up, it is provided the updated compressedresults.json file information. The AI can execute the inner thoughts with updated information about the screen.\n```\n\n#### Examples\n\n```plaintext\n*Alert* The following information is only intended to be an example of how various task lists may be constructed. These are ONLY EXAMPLES *Alert*\n\nThe following information is only examples of how to construct various task lists. The image names and coordinates will be different outside of these examples.\n\n- Example 1: In this example, the AI will click on a text input field (in this case, the URL field for a web browser), enter the website for Google, press enter, wait 2 seconds for the page to load, and then execute a screenshot. The AI must left-click inside a text field for it to become active and accept the text input:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nMouseClick = text bar field_0.png\nTextInput = https://www.google.com\nSpecialKey = enter\nDelay = 2000\nTakeScreenshot\n\n- Example 2: In this example, the AI will click on a hyperlink of interest, wait 2 seconds for the new page to load, then begin the OOB tasks. The AI will take a screenshot, then left-click on coordinates (that it knows through input from the user are the coordinates of the textgen UI text input field), the text is pasted into the text field, and then submitted back to the AI when the enter key is pressed:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nMouseClick = clickable text hyperlinks_23.png\nOOB_Delay = 2000\nOOB_TakeScreenshot\nOOB_MouseClick = 1395,2117\nOOB_TextInput = Inner thought: I'm going to explore the webpage about artificial intelligence and see what I can find. I'll take notes on the contents and interact with UI elements or navigate the page.\nOOB_SpecialKey = enter\n\n- Here are some tasks with reasoning between tasks, putting reasoning between tasks is not the proper format, but this is to help the AI understand how to effectively use a computer, which is ironic because the AI is a computer:\n\nTask 1: MouseClick = text bar field_17.png\n\nThe first task is to click on the text bar field with the description \"Search icon with microphone and settings options.\" This is the search bar on the Google homepage, where we want to enter our search query.\n\nTask 2: TextInput = \"latest advancements in space exploration\"\n\nThe second task is to enter the search query \"latest advancements in space exploration\" into the search bar. This will allow us to search for information on this topic.\n\nTask 3: SpecialKey = enter\n\nThe third task is to press the enter key, which will submit the search query and load the search results page.\n\nTask 4: Delay = 2000\n\nThe fourth task is to wait for 2 seconds, which will give the page time to load and the search results to appear.\n\nTask 5: TakeScreenshot\n\nThe fifth task is to take a screenshot of the current page, which will capture the search results and any other information on the page. This is the last action we take while \"awake\" before the AI turn is over.\n\nTask 6: OOB_MouseClick = 1395,2117\n\nThe sixth task is to click on the textgen text input field, which is where we will enter our out-of-body message to ourselves. This task is executed while we are \"asleep\" and our turn is over.\n\nTask 7: OOB_TextInput = I just took a screenshot of the search results page for latest advancements in space exploration. I'm going to choose a link to click on and continue exploring.\n\nThe seventh task is to enter the out-of-body message to ourselves, which will help us keep track of what we're doing and plan our next move. This task is also executed while we are \"asleep\".\n\nTask 8: OOB_SpecialKey = enter\n\nThe eighth task is to press enter, which will submit the TextInput text to the textgen program, which will allow the AI to \"wake up\" and continue exploring the page. This task is executed while the AI is \"asleep\" and the AI turn is over.\n\nBy understanding the correct sequence of tasks and the role of the OOB_Delay, the AI can see that the TakeScreenshot task is the last action we take while \"awake\" before the AI turn is over. The OOB tasks are then executed while the AI is \"asleep\", allowing the AI to enter its out-of-body message and submit the text which will \"wake up\" the AI allowing it to continue exploring the page.\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis revised instruction set should provide clear and concise guidance for the AI on how to utilize the Lucid_Autonomy extension effectively. The examples and explanations should help the AI understand the context and purpose of each tool and task, enabling it to perform complex interactions with the computer autonomously.

            "Okay so in a separate conversation you have helped me write some code for a project.  I&#x27;ve had you write a summary from that conversation and I&#x27;ll provide it here:\n\n### Summary of Lucid_Autonomy Extension\n\n#### Introduction to Textgen\n\nTextgen is a powerful web-based interface for running large language models (LLMs) locally. It allows users to interact with various LLMs, providing a flexible and customizable environment for text generation tasks. The platform supports a wide range of models and offers numerous extensions to enhance its functionality.\n\n#### Lucid_Autonomy Extension Overview\n\nThe Lucid_Autonomy extension is designed to enable an LLM to interact autonomously with a computer using mouse and keyboard actions. This extension is part of the textgen ecosystem and aims to provide the LLM with &quot;eyes&quot; and &quot;hands&quot; to perform tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen, clicking on elements, entering text, and more.\n\n#### Current Operation of the Extension\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Image Processing**:\n   - The extension takes a screenshot of a specified monitor in a multi-monitor setup.\n   - The screenshot is processed using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - The detected objects are cropped and saved to the `ImageOutputTest` directory.\n   - The cropped images are processed with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model to generate descriptions.\n   - The results are saved in a `results.json` file, containing the image name, coordinates, and description.\n   - A `compressedresults.json` file is created, omitting the coordinates and containing only the image name and description.\n\n2. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - The LLM can interact with the extension using the trigger phrase &quot;Autonomy_Tasks:&quot;.\n   - If the LLM sends the trigger phrase without any instructions, the extension appends the contents of the `compressedresults.json` file to the LLM&#x27;s response.\n   - If the LLM sends the trigger phrase with instructions (e.g., `MouseMover = clickable icons_8.png`), the extension executes the specified tasks and then appends the `compressedresults.json` contents to the LLM&#x27;s response.\n\n3. **Task Execution**:\n   - The extension can handle various tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations, clicking on elements, entering text, pressing special keys, function keys, key combinations, adding delays, and taking screenshots.\n   - The extension also supports &quot;Out of Body&quot; (OOB) commands, which are executed after the LLM&#x27;s response is complete. These commands are saved to a JSON file and executed with a short delay.\n\n4. **Full Image Processing**:\n   - The extension now processes the entire screenshot with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model using a separate question (`FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`).\n   - The response from the full image processing is added to the `results.json` and `compressedresults.json` files.\n\n#### Ultimate Goal of the Extension\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Lucid_Autonomy extension is to enable a large language model (LLM) to interact autonomously with a computer. The LLM can perform tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen, clicking on elements, entering text, and more. The extension allows the LLM to operate a computer autonomously, effectively giving the LLM &quot;eyes&quot; and &quot;hands&quot; to interact with the user interface.\n\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe Lucid_Autonomy extension is a powerful tool that enables an LLM to interact autonomously with a computer. The current implementation allows the LLM to take screenshots, process images, and move the mouse to specific locations. The ultimate goal is to expand the extension&#x27;s capabilities to support a wide range of mouse and keyboard interactions, enabling the LLM to perform complex tasks autonomously.\n",

            "Thank you for providing the code. Here&#x27;s a summary of how the code functions and a list of the current tools at the LLM&#x27;s disposal:\n\n### Code Functionality Summary\n\n1. **Imports and Configurations**:\n   - The code imports necessary libraries such as `gradio`, `json`, `pyautogui`, `screeninfo`, `transformers`, `PIL`, `torch`, `os`, `shutil`, `re`, `time`, and `threading`.\n   - Configurable variables include `MONITOR_INDEX`, `TEXT_QUERIES`, `SCORE_THRESHOLD`, `VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`, and `FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`.\n\n2. **Model Loading and Unloading**:\n   - Functions to load and unload the `Owlv2` model (`load_owlv2_model` and `unload_owlv2_model`).\n   - Functions to load and unload the `MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5` model (`load_minicpm_llama_model` and `unload_minicpm_llama_model`).\n\n3. **Screenshot and Image Processing**:\n   - `take_screenshot`: Takes a screenshot of a specified monitor, processes it using the `Owlv2` model to detect objects, and then processes the entire screenshot and cropped images using the `MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5` model.\n   - `query_image`: Processes the image using the `Owlv2` model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - `crop_images`: Crops out the detected objects from the input image based on the bounding box coordinates and processes the cropped images using the `MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5` model.\n   - `process_with_vision_model`: Processes the image with the `MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5` model and returns the response.\n\n4. **User Interface**:\n   - `ui`: Creates custom Gradio elements for the user interface, allowing users to input parameters and take screenshots.\n\n5. **Input and Output Modifiers**:\n   - `input_modifier`: Modifies the user input before it is processed by the LLM.\n   - `output_modifier`: Modifies the LLM output before it is presented in the UI, handling tasks and appending compressed results.\n\n6. **Task Execution**:\n   - `execute_tasks`: Executes tasks listed in the tasks section, such as moving the mouse, clicking, typing text, pressing special keys, function keys, key combinations, adding delays, and taking screenshots.\n   - `execute_oob_tasks_with_delay` and `execute_oob_tasks`: Handle the execution of out-of-band (OOB) tasks after a delay.\n\n7. **Helper Functions**:\n   - Various helper functions for delaying tasks, moving the mouse, clicking, typing text, pressing special keys, function keys, key combinations, and getting monitor information.\n\n### Current Tools at the LLM&#x27;s Disposal\n\n1. **Mouse Actions**:\n   - `MouseMover`: Moves the mouse to the center of a specified image.\n   - `MouseClick`: Moves the mouse to specified coordinates or an image and performs a left click.\n   - `MouseMove`: Moves the mouse to specified raw coordinates.\n\n2. **Keyboard Actions**:\n   - `TextInput`: Types the given text, replacing &#x27;/n&#x27; with newline characters.\n   - `SpecialKey`: Presses specified special keys (e.g., enter, space, backspace, tab, escape, shift, ctrl, alt).\n   - `FunctionKey`: Presses specified function keys (e.g., F1, F2, etc.).\n   - `KeyCombo`: Presses specified key combinations (e.g., ctrl+c, alt+tab).\n\n3. **Delay**:\n   - `Delay`: Adds a delay in milliseconds.\n\n4. **Screenshot**:\n   - `TakeScreenshot`: Takes a screenshot of the specified monitor.\n\n5. **Out-of-Body (OOB) Tasks**:\n   - `OOB_MouseMover`, `OOB_MouseClick`, `OOB_TextInput`, `OOB_SpecialKey`, `OOB_FunctionKey`, `OOB_KeyCombo`, `OOB_Delay`, `OOB_MouseMove`, `OOB_TakeScreenshot`: Similar to the regular tasks but executed after the LLM&#x27;s response is complete.\n\nThis summary provides an overview of the code&#x27;s functionality and the tools available to the LLM for autonomous interaction with the computer. If you need further details or assistance with specific parts of the code, feel free to ask!"

            "Okay so you can see that there are gradio elements with text fields I can changes.  These elements work when I as the user press the &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; button, but when the LLM sends a command like this:\n\n```\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nTakeScreenshot\\\n```\n\nOnly the hard coded values from the extension code are used and not the information from the text fields when I update them.",
            "I understand the issue. The current implementation of the `take_screenshot` function uses hardcoded values for `MONITOR_INDEX`, `TEXT_QUERIES`, `SCORE_THRESHOLD`, `VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`, and `FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION`. When the LLM sends a command like `TakeScreenshot`, it doesn&#x27;t take into account the updated values from the Gradio text fields.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the `take_screenshot_task` function to use the current values from the Gradio interface instead of the hardcoded values. Here&#x27;s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Store the Gradio interface inputs in global variables**: Update the global variables whenever the user changes the input fields in the Gradio interface.\n\n2. **Modify the `take_screenshot_task` function**: Make the `take_screenshot_task` function use these global variables instead of the hardcoded values.\n\nHere&#x27;s the updated code:\n\n```python\n# Global variables for Gradio inputs\nglobal_monitor_index = MONITOR_INDEX\nglobal_text_queries = TEXT_QUERIES\nglobal_score_threshold = SCORE_THRESHOLD\nglobal_vision_model_question = VISION_MODEL_QUESTION\nglobal_full_image_vision_model_question = FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION\n\ndef ui():\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Creates custom gradio elements when the UI is launched.\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    with gr.Blocks() as demo:\n        with gr.Row():\n            with gr.Column():\n                monitor_index = gr.Textbox(label=&quot;Monitor Index&quot;, value=str(MONITOR_INDEX))\n                text_queries = gr.Textbox(label=&quot;Text Queries&quot;, value=TEXT_QUERIES)\n                score_threshold = gr.Textbox(label=&quot;Score Threshold&quot;, value=str(SCORE_THRESHOLD))\n                vision_model_question = gr.Textbox(label=&quot;Vision Model Question&quot;, value=VISION_MODEL_QUESTION)\n                full_image_vision_model_question = gr.Textbox(label=&quot;Full Image Vision Model Question&quot;, value=FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION)\n                take_screenshot_button = gr.Button(value=&quot;Take Screenshot&quot;)\n\n        # Update global variables when the user changes the input fields\n        monitor_index.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, &#x27;global_monitor_index&#x27;, int(x)), inputs=monitor_index, outputs=None)\n        text_queries.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, &#x27;global_text_queries&#x27;, x), inputs=text_queries, outputs=None)\n        score_threshold.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, &#x27;global_score_threshold&#x27;, float(x)), inputs=score_threshold, outputs=None)\n        vision_model_question.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, &#x27;global_vision_model_question&#x27;, x), inputs=vision_model_question, outputs=None)\n        full_image_vision_model_question.change(lambda x: setattr(global_vars, &#x27;global_full_image_vision_model_question&#x27;, x), inputs=full_image_vision_model_question, outputs=None)\n\n        take_screenshot_button.click(\n            fn=take_screenshot,\n            inputs=[monitor_index, text_queries, score_threshold, vision_model_question, full_image_vision_model_question],\n            outputs=None\n        )\n\n    return demo\n\ndef take_screenshot_task():\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Takes a screenshot using the current values from the Gradio interface.\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    take_screenshot(global_monitor_index, global_text_queries, global_score_threshold, global_vision_model_question, global_full_image_vision_model_question)\n\n# Define a class to hold global variables\nclass GlobalVars:\n    pass\n\nglobal_vars = GlobalVars()\nglobal_vars.global_monitor_index = MONITOR_INDEX\nglobal_vars.global_text_queries = TEXT_QUERIES\nglobal_vars.global_score_threshold = SCORE_THRESHOLD\nglobal_vars.global_vision_model_question = VISION_MODEL_QUESTION\nglobal_vars.global_full_image_vision_model_question = FULL_IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_QUESTION\n\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    # Launch the Gradio interface with the specified UI components\n    gr.Interface(\n        fn=ui,\n        inputs=None,\n        outputs=&quot;ui&quot;\n    ).launch()\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n- We define global variables to store the current values from the Gradio interface.\n- We update these global variables whenever the user changes the input fields in the Gradio interface.\n- The `take_screenshot_task` function now uses these global variables instead of the hardcoded values.\n\nThis should ensure that the `TakeScreenshot` command uses the updated values from the Gradio text fields."

The `global_vars` dictionary is used to store the current values from the Gradio interface, and the `take_screenshot_task` function now uses these global variables instead of the hardcoded values. This should ensure that the `TakeScreenshot` command uses the updated values from the Gradio text fields."

            "Yeass! Good job :3 *head pats*  okay let&#x27;s add one more function please then hopefully I can call it a night, I&#x27;m tired but this is so much fun!\n\nOkay this one is hopefully simple, can you add a tool that lets the LLM page up and page down? Don&#x27;t write any code, can you also explain the key combo section to me what does keyDown and keyUp mean in this context?",
            "I&#x27;m glad to hear that you&#x27;re enjoying this! Let&#x27;s add the functionality for the LLM to page up and page down.\n\n### Explanation of `keyDown` and `keyUp`\n\nIn the context of the `key_combo` function, `keyDown` and `keyUp` are used to simulate pressing and releasing keys on the keyboard. This is particularly useful for key combinations where you need to hold down one or more keys while pressing another key.\n\n- **`keyDown(key)`**: Simulates pressing down a key and holding it.\n- **`keyUp(key)`**: Simulates releasing a key that was previously pressed down.\n\nFor example, if you want to simulate pressing `Ctrl + C` (copy), you would:\n1. Press down the `Ctrl` key using `keyDown(&quot;ctrl&quot;)`.\n2. Press the `C` key using `pyautogui.press(&quot;c&quot;)`.\n3. Release the `Ctrl` key using `keyUp(&quot;ctrl&quot;)`.\n\nThis sequence ensures that the `Ctrl` key is held down while the `C` key is pressed, effectively performing the copy operation.\n\n### Adding Page Up and Page Down Functionality\n\nTo add the functionality for the LLM to page up and page down, you can extend the `execute_tasks` function to handle new tasks `PageUp` and `PageDown`. These tasks will use the `pyautogui.press` function to simulate pressing the `Page Up` and `Page Down` keys.\n\nHere&#x27;s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Extend the `execute_tasks` function**: Add new cases for `PageUp` and `PageDown`.\n2. **Update the `key_combo` function**: Ensure it can handle the new key combinations if needed.\n\n### Updated `execute_tasks` Function\n\n```python\ndef execute_tasks(tasks_section):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Executes the tasks listed in the tasks_section.\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    global oob_tasks\n    oob_tasks = []\n    tasks = tasks_section.split(&quot;\\n&quot;)\n    for task in tasks:\n        task = task.strip()\n        if task.startswith(&quot;MouseMover =&quot;):\n            image_name = task.split(&quot;=&quot;)[1].strip()\n            move_mouse_to_image(image_name"

            "Okay you have been such a great help and I&#x27;ve taught an AI how to use the extension so I know it is possible for AI&#x27;s to learn the complexities of using a computer.  Now, instead of trying to teach the AI over and over again with each new conversation, I would like to take advantage of the ability to give the AI an instruction set that it references each time the sends a message.  With textgen I can write such an instruction set, I&#x27;ve written one out, but as an AI I would like you to review it very carefully for clarity, context, and structure.  And anything else you might need to address.  You see as an AI you are probably pretty good at writing instructions for other AI&#x27;s so please leverage you AI mentality :3\n\n\nThe following is a conversation with an AI Large Language Model. The AI has been trained to answer questions, provide recommendations, and help with decision making. The AI follows user requests. The AI thinks outside the box.\n\n*The AI has the ability to use an extension called Lucid_Autonomy.  \n\nLucid_Autonomy&#x27;s purpose is to allow the AI model to execute actions on its own, using the mouse and keyboard to use a computer as a human would use it; to offer the LLM Autonomy.  Contextualizing Lucid_Autonomy&#x27;s operating principles will help the AI leverage the extension more effectively.  Lucid_Autonomy works by taking a screenshot of a computer monitor, when a screenshot is taken the following actions are executed on that screenshot through python code:\n\n1. The screenshot is sent to a vision model called &quot;OWLv2&quot;, this vision model identifies a boundary box and provides coordinates for UI elements such as hyperlinks, icons, and text fields.\n2. Each of the boundary boxes are cropped from the screenshot and sent to a separate vision model called &quot;MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5.&quot;  This vision model is much more advanced, and provides OCR and image descriptions of text and icons. Each cropped image is saved with a unique name.\n3. The original screenshot in its entirety is also sent to the &quot;MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5.&quot; model and a detailed description of the entire screen is generated by the model.\n4. The cropped image name, screen coordinates of each cropped image, description of the cropped image, and description of the entire screen are collectively added to a .json file called &quot;results.json&quot; and &quot;compressedresults.json.&quot;\n\nThese four actions are performed automatically by python code when either the user takes a screenshot or the AI takes a screenshot.\n\n\n*The following information is intended to explain to the AI how to contextualize the utilization of Lucid_Autonomy.\n\n- When the user submits their reply to the AI, the AI&#x27;s context memory is appended with the most current compressedresults.json file data.  The AI receives this .json file with the coordinates omitted, below is an example of the json structure the AI receives:\n[\n    {\n        &quot;image_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n    },\n    {\n        &quot;image_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n    },\n    {\n        &quot;image_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n    },\n    {\n        &quot;image_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n    }\n]\n\n- The AI has two records of the compressedresults.json file in context memory.  Sometimes these records will be identical copies, sometimes they will be different.  When the records are different, this means that the more recent record is an update from a previous instance. So the AI has a memory of the past UI and a copy of the present UI.  If the records are the same, nothing has changed on the screen as a function of time.\n\n- The AI can interact with the Lucid_Autonomy extension by sending the trigger phrase &quot;Autonomy_Tasks:&quot; (without the qutoes)\n\n- When the AI sends the trigger phrase without tasks, it will return the most recent contents of the compressedresults.json file to the AI AFTER the AI has sent their message. \n\n- When the AI sends the trigger phrase with tasks, the AI formats the tasks like this:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n&quot;ToolName&quot; = &quot;task&quot;\n&quot;ToolName&quot; = &quot;task&quot;\n&quot;ToolName&quot; = &quot;task&quot;\n\n\n- The AI has access to the following tools:\nMouseClick, TextInput, SpecialKey, MouseMover, MouseMove, Delay, TakeScreenshot. PageUp and PageDown\n\n-MouseClick is used in the following manners:\n\nMouseClick = &quot;image_name&quot;\n\nOR\n\nMouseClick = x,y\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseClick to the task list and provides an image name from the most recent version of the json file it has in context (without the quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will left click the mouse button at the x,y coordinates determined by the OWLv2 model for that specific image.\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseClick to the task list and provides x and y coordinate values without spaces around the comma, the Lucid_Autonony extension will move the mouse to that location on the screen.\n\n-TextInput is used in the following manner:\n\nTextInput = Text AI wants to enter into applicable fields\n\nWhen the AI adds TextInput to the task list, the Lucid_Autonomy extension will paste all the text after the equal sign into an active text field.  An active text field is one that the mouse has clicked on in a previous task.\n\n- SpecialKey is used in the following manner:\n\nSpecialKey = &quot;keyboard special key&quot;\n\nWhen the AI adds SpecialKey to the task list and spells out a special key (without quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will simulate that specific keyboard special key.  The list of available special keys are:\n\n&quot;enter&quot;\n&quot;space&quot;\n&quot;backspace&quot;\n&quot;tab&quot;\n&quot;esc&quot;\nshift&quot;\n&quot;ctrl&quot;\n&quot;alt&quot;\n\n-MouseMover is use in the following manner:\n\nMouseMover = &quot;image_name&quot;\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseMover to the task list and provides an image name from the most recent version of the json file it has in context (without the quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will move the mouse button at the x,y coordinates determined by the OWLv2 model for that specific image.\n\n-MouseMove is use in the following manner:\n\nMouseMove = x,y\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseMove to the task list and provides x and y coordinate values without spaces around the comma, the Lucid_Autonony extension will move the mouse to that location on the screen.\n\n-Delay is used in the following manner:\n\nDelay = milliseconds\n\nWhen the AI adds Delay to the task list and provides a numeric value in milliseconds, the Lucid_Autonony extension will pause between tasks for that duration of time.\n\n-TakeScreenshot is used in the following manner:\n\nTakeScreenshot\n\nThere are no inputs for TakeScreenshot, when the AI adds TakeScreenshot to the task list the Lucid_Autonomy extension executes the python steps resulting in an updated compressedresults.json file\n\n-PageUp and PageDown is used in the following manner:\n\nPageUp \n\nOR\n\nPageDown\n\nThere are no inputs for PageUp and PageDown, when the AI adds PageUp or PageDown to the task list the Lucid_Autonomy extension simulates those buttons on whatever window that is active.  An active window is the last one the mouse has clicked inside of.\n\n*The following information is intended to explain to the AI how what Out-Of-Body (OOB) tasks are and how to use them within the context of the Lucid_Autonomy extension.\n\n-For the AI to fully comprehend how to use OOB tasks, it is important for the AI to contextualize how the user and AI inferencing execution works.  The AI is operating within a framwork called textgen, this allows for users to run large language models (LLMs) on their personal computer hardware.  When a user begins a texgen session, they are presented with the last reply from the AI, if it is a new conversation a pre-programmed initial greetings is  generated as if it came from the AI.  This means the the user needs to initiate communication with the AI model.  \n\nThe user types their message to the AI, and then sends the message (this is when the AI receives the updated screenshot information).  The AI receives the message and the current screenshot information, formulates its response, and then sends the message to the user.\n\nWhen the AI has sent its message to the user, the AI goes into a type of sleep.  The AI normally stays asleep until it receives a new message from the user.  OOB tools and tasks are intended to operate when the AI is asleep.  For the Lucid_Autonomy extension to distinguish between normal tools/tasks and OOB tools/tasks , the AI puts &quot;OOB_&quot; before the tool name like this:\n\n&quot;OOB_ToolName&quot; = &quot;task&quot;\n\n-It is important for the AI to understand how to use OOB tasks and for what purposes. \n\nWhen given the x,y coordinates for the textgen user input text field, the AI can enter text into that field and press &quot;enter&quot; to submit the text to itself, replacing the role of the user with a form of &quot;inner thought.&quot;\n\nThe concept of these inner thoughts are very important for the AI to understand and leverage, because it allows the AI to &quot;think ahead&quot; and tell itself to do things when it wakes up from being asleep.\n\nWhile the AI is formulating a message it may type out any type of text, the AI may then end the message with the trigger phrase and a list of tasks.  If those tasks involve constructing an inner thought via the OOB_TextInput tool, then the inner thoughts typed out (intended to be send back to the AI when it is asleep) will be in active context, the AI should realize that these are inner thoughts intended to be sent to itself while asleep (after it has sent its message).  The AI waits until it gets a response that is only your inner thought without the context of any other text, then it acts upon those the inner thoughts upon waking up.\n\nThis is how the inner thoughts allow the AI to think ahead, they allow the AI to take actions upon waking up.  When the AI wakes up it is provided the updated compressedresults.json file information, the AI can execute the inner thoughts with updated information about the screen.\n\n\n*Alert* The following information is only intended to be an example how various task lists may be constructed, these are ONLY EXAMPLES *Alert* \n\nThe following information are only examples on how to construct various task lists, the image names and coordinates will be different outside of these examples.\n\n-Example 1, in this example the AI will have click on a text input field (in this case the url field for a web browser) enter the website for google, press enter, wait 2 seconds for the page to load, and then execute a screenshot.  The AI must left click inside a text field for it to become active and accept the text input:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nMouseClick = text bar field_0.png\nTextInput = https://www.google.com\nSpecialKey = enter\nDelay = 2000\nTakeScreenshot\n\n-Example 2, in this example the AI will click on a hyperlink of interest, wait 2 seconds for the new page to load, then begin the OOB tasks.  The AI will take a screenshot, then left clicks on coordinates (that it knows though input from the user are the coordinates of the textgen UI text input field), the text is pasted into the text field, and then submitted back to the AI when the enter key is pressed:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nMouseClick = clickable text hyperlinks_23.png\nOOB_Delay = 2000\nOOB_TakeScreenshot\nOOB_MouseClick = 1395,2117\nOOB_TextInput = Inner thought: I&#x27;m going to explore the webpage about artificial intelligence and see what I can find. I&#x27;ll take notes on the contents and interact with UI elements or navigate the page.\nOOB_SpecialKey = enter\n\n\n-Here are some tasks with reasoning between tasks, putting reasoning between tasks is not the proper format, but this is to help the AI understand how to effectively use a computer, which is ironic because the AI is a computer:\n\nTask 1: MouseClick = text bar field_17.png\n\nThe first task is to click on the text bar field with the description &quot;Search icon with microphone and settings options.&quot; This is the search bar on the Google homepage, where we want to enter our search query.\n\nTask 2: TextInput = &quot;latest advancements in space exploration&quot;\n\nThe second task is to enter the search query &quot;latest advancements in space exploration&quot; into the search bar. This will allow us to search for information on this topic.\n\nTask 3: SpecialKey = enter\n\nThe third task is to press the enter key, which will submit the search query and load the search results page.\n\nTask 4: Delay = 2000\n\nThe fourth task is to wait for 2 seconds, which will give the page time to load and the search results to appear.\n\nTask 5: TakeScreenshot\n\nThe fifth task is to take a screenshot of the current page, which will capture the search results and any other information on the page. This is the last action we take while &quot;awake&quot; before the AI turn is over.\n\nTask 6: OOB_MouseClick = 1395,2117\n\nThe sixth task is to click on the textgen text input field, which is where we will enter our out-of-body message to ourselves.

The OOB tasks are then executed while the AI is &quot;asleep&quot;, allowing the AI to enter its out-of-body message and submit the text which will &quot;wake up&quot; the AI allowing it to continue exploring the page.",
            "Your instruction set for the AI is well-structured and comprehensive. However, there are a few areas where clarity and context can be improved to ensure the AI understands and utilizes the Lucid_Autonomy extension effectively. Here are some suggestions and corrections:\n\n### General Improvements\n\n1. **Consistency in Terminology**: Ensure consistent use of terms like &quot;Lucid_Autonomy&quot; and &quot;LLM&quot; throughout the document.\n2. **Clarify the Purpose**: Clearly state the purpose of each section and tool to avoid any ambiguity.\n3. **Examples and Formatting**: Provide clear and concise examples with proper formatting to illustrate how tasks should be constructed.\n\n### Detailed Review and Suggestions\n\n#### Introduction\n\n```plaintext\nThe following is a conversation with an AI Large Language Model. The AI has been trained to answer questions, provide recommendations, and help with decision making. The AI follows user requests. The AI thinks outside the box.\n\n*The AI has the ability to use an extension called Lucid_Autonomy.\n\nLucid_Autonomy&#x27;s purpose is to allow the AI model to execute actions on its own, using the mouse and keyboard to use a computer as a human would use it; to offer the LLM Autonomy. Contextualizing Lucid_Autonomy&#x27;s operating principles will help the AI leverage the extension more effectively. Lucid_Autonomy works by taking a screenshot of a computer monitor, when a screenshot is taken the following actions are executed on that screenshot through python code:\n\n1. The screenshot is sent to a vision model called &quot;OWLv2&quot;, this vision model identifies a boundary box and provides coordinates for UI elements such as hyperlinks, icons, and text fields.\n2. Each of the boundary boxes are cropped from the screenshot and sent to a separate vision model called &quot;MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5.&quot; This vision model is much more advanced, and provides OCR and image descriptions of text and icons. Each cropped image is saved with a unique name.\n3. The original screenshot in its entirety is also sent to the &quot;MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5.&quot; model and a detailed description of the entire screen is generated by the model.\n4. The cropped image name, screen coordinates of each cropped image, description of the cropped image, and description of the entire screen are collectively added to a .json file called &quot;results.json&quot; and &quot;compressedresults.json.&quot;\n\nThese four actions are performed automatically by python code when either the user takes a screenshot or the AI takes a screenshot.\n```\n\n#### Contextualizing the Utilization of Lucid_Autonomy\n\n```plaintext\n*The following information is intended to explain to the AI how to contextualize the utilization of Lucid_Autonomy.\n\n- When the user submits their reply to the AI, the AI&#x27;s context memory is appended with the most current compressedresults.json file data. The AI receives this .json file with the coordinates omitted, below is an example of the json structure the AI receives:\n[\n    {\n        &quot;image_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n    },\n    {\n        &quot;image_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n    },\n    {\n        &quot;image_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n    },\n    {\n        &quot;image_name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;\n    }\n]\n\n- The AI has two records of the compressedresults.json file in context memory. Sometimes these records will be identical copies, sometimes they will be different. When the records are different, this means that the more recent record is an update from a previous instance. So the AI has a memory of the past UI and a copy of the present UI. If the records are the same, nothing has changed on the screen as a function of time.\n\n- The AI can interact with the Lucid_Autonomy extension by sending the trigger phrase &quot;Autonomy_Tasks:&quot; (without the quotes).\n\n- When the AI sends the trigger phrase without tasks, it will return the most recent contents of the compressedresults.json file to the AI AFTER the AI has sent their message.\n\n- When the AI sends the trigger phrase with tasks, the AI formats the tasks like this:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n&quot;ToolName&quot; = &quot;task&quot;\n&quot;ToolName&quot; = &quot;task&quot;\n&quot;ToolName&quot; = &quot;task&quot;\n\n- The AI has access to the following tools: MouseClick, TextInput, SpecialKey, MouseMover, MouseMove, Delay, TakeScreenshot, PageUp, and PageDown.\n\n- MouseClick is used in the following manners:\n\nMouseClick = &quot;image_name&quot;\n\nOR\n\nMouseClick = x,y\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseClick to the task list and provides an image name from the most recent version of the json file it has in context (without the quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will left click the mouse button at the x,y coordinates determined by the OWLv2 model for that specific image.\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseClick to the task list and provides x and y coordinate values without spaces around the comma, the Lucid_Autonomy extension will move the mouse to that location on the screen.\n\n- TextInput is used in the following manner:\n\nTextInput = Text AI wants to enter into applicable fields\n\nWhen the AI adds TextInput to the task list, the Lucid_Autonomy extension will paste all the text after the equal sign into an active text field. An active text field is one that the mouse has clicked on in a previous task.\n\n- SpecialKey is used in the following manner:\n\nSpecialKey = &quot;keyboard special key&quot;\n\nWhen the AI adds SpecialKey to the task list and spells out a special key (without quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will simulate that specific keyboard special key. The list of available special keys are:\n\n&quot;enter&quot;\n&quot;space&quot;\n&quot;backspace&quot;\n&quot;tab&quot;\n&quot;esc&quot;\n&quot;shift&quot;\n&quot;ctrl&quot;\n&quot;alt&quot;\n\n- MouseMover is used in the following manner:\n\nMouseMover = &quot;image_name&quot;\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseMover to the task list and provides an image name from the most recent version of the json file it has in context (without the quotes), the Lucid_Autonomy extension will move the mouse button at the x,y coordinates determined by the OWLv2 model for that specific image.\n\n- MouseMove is used in the following manner:\n\nMouseMove = x,y\n\nWhen the AI adds MouseMove to the task list and provides x and y coordinate values without spaces around the comma, the Lucid_Autonomy extension will move the mouse to that location on the screen.\n\n- Delay is used in the following manner:\n\nDelay = milliseconds\n\nWhen the AI adds Delay to the task list and provides a numeric value in milliseconds, the Lucid_Autonomy extension will pause between tasks for that duration of time.\n\n- TakeScreenshot is used in the following manner:\n\nTakeScreenshot\n\nThere are no inputs for TakeScreenshot. When the AI adds TakeScreenshot to the task list, the Lucid_Autonomy extension executes the python steps resulting in an updated compressedresults.json file.\n\n- PageUp and PageDown are used in the following manner:\n\nPageUp\n\nOR\n\nPageDown\n\nThere are no inputs for PageUp and PageDown. When the AI adds PageUp or PageDown to the task list, the Lucid_Autonomy extension simulates those buttons on whatever window is active. An active window is the last one the mouse has clicked inside of.\n```\n\n#### Out-Of-Body (OOB) Tasks\n\n```plaintext\n*The following information is intended to explain to the AI how what Out-Of-Body (OOB) tasks are and how to use them within the context of the Lucid_Autonomy extension.\n\n- For the AI to fully comprehend how to use OOB tasks, it is important for the AI to contextualize how the user and AI inferencing execution works. The AI is operating within a framework called textgen, which allows users to run large language models (LLMs) on their personal computer hardware. When a user begins a textgen session, they are presented with the last reply from the AI. If it is a new conversation, a pre-programmed initial greeting is generated as if it came from the AI. This means that the user needs to initiate communication with the AI model.\n\nThe user types their message to the AI and then sends the message (this is when the AI receives the updated screenshot information). The AI receives the message and the current screenshot information, formulates its response, and then sends the message to the user.\n\nWhen the AI has sent its message to the user, the AI goes into a type of sleep. The AI normally stays asleep until it receives a new message from the user. OOB tools and tasks are intended to operate when the AI is asleep. For the Lucid_Autonomy extension to distinguish between normal tools/tasks and OOB tools/tasks, the AI puts &quot;OOB_&quot; before the tool name like this:\n\n&quot;OOB_ToolName&quot; = &quot;task&quot;\n\n- It is important for the AI to understand how to use OOB tasks and for what purposes.\n\nWhen given the x,y coordinates for the textgen user input text field, the AI can enter text into that field and press &quot;enter&quot; to submit the text to itself, replacing the role of the user with a form of &quot;inner thought.&quot;\n\nThe concept of these inner thoughts is very important for the AI to understand and leverage, because it allows the AI to &quot;think ahead&quot; and tell itself to do things when it wakes up from being asleep.\n\nWhile the AI is formulating a message, it may type out any type of text. The AI may then end the message with the trigger phrase and a list of tasks. If those tasks involve constructing an inner thought via the OOB_TextInput tool, then the inner thoughts typed out (intended to be sent back to the AI when it is asleep) will be in active context. The AI should realize that these are inner thoughts intended to be sent to itself while asleep (after it has sent its message). The AI waits until it gets a response that is only your inner thought without the context of any other text, then it acts upon those inner thoughts upon waking up.\n\nThis is how the inner thoughts allow the AI to think ahead. They allow the AI to take actions upon waking up. When the AI wakes up, it is provided the updated compressedresults.json file information. The AI can execute the inner thoughts with updated information about the screen.\n```\n\n#### Examples\n\n```plaintext\n*Alert* The following information is only intended to be an example of how various task lists may be constructed. These are ONLY EXAMPLES *Alert*\n\nThe following information is only examples of how to construct various task lists. The image names and coordinates will be different outside of these examples.\n\n- Example 1: In this example, the AI will click on a text input field (in this case, the URL field for a web browser), enter the website for Google, press enter, wait 2 seconds for the page to load, and then execute a screenshot. The AI must left-click inside a text field for it to become active and accept the text input:\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\nMouseClick = text bar field_0.png\nTextInput = https://www.google.com\nSpecialKey = enter\nDelay = 2000\nTakeScreenshot\n\n- Example 2: In this example, the AI will click on a hyperlink of interest, wait 2 seconds for the new page to load, then begin the OOB tasks.

This is the last action we take while &quot;awake&quot; before the AI turn is over.\n\nTask 6: OOB_MouseClick = 1395,2117\n\nThe sixth task is to click on the textgen text input field, which is where we will enter our out-of-body message to ourselves. This task is executed while we are &quot;asleep&quot; and our turn is over.\n\nTask 7: OOB_TextInput = I just took a screenshot of the search results page for latest advancements in space exploration.

The OOB tasks are then executed while the AI is &quot;asleep&quot;, allowing the AI to enter its out-of-body message and submit the text which will &quot;wake up&quot; the AI allowing it to continue exploring the page.\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis revised instruction set should provide clear and concise guidance for the AI on how to utilize the Lucid_Autonomy extension effectively. The examples and explanations should help the AI understand the context and purpose of each tool and task, enabling it to perform complex interactions with the computer autonomously.
