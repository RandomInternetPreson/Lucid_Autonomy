            "Okay, so we've got quite an adventure ahead of us. Let me give you some context. There is a GitHub project called TextGenerationWebUI. We'll call it TextGen from now on. What TextGen allows us to do, it allows me to run large language models at home on my own hardware. So you're actually running on my computer right now locally. No internet connection. Anyways, TextGen allows for really interesting extension integration. And I've made two extensions myself, and I'll show you the code for all that later. But the gist of it is one extension lets the AI surf the internet in a somewhat supervised manner. And another extension gives the AI or the large language model the ability to communicate with a vision model. So the large language model formulates questions on its own, asks those questions of the vision model and gets a response. And then contextualizes that response into the conversation. The large language model can even recall past images on their own when they decide it's necessary within the context of the conversation. That latter, okay, well, so the two extensions are called LucidWebSearch and LucidVision. And LucidVision was actually entirely written by Mixtral8x22, which was like a 8x22 model of experts model. It's like your predecessor. You're supposed to be better than it. So I've upgraded to Mistral Large V2, which is you. And I want to take on a similar endeavor. I want you to write an extension for TextGen for me. But we're going to take this step by step. First of all, let me... First of all, just before I go into any more explanation, I just want to make sure you're understanding what I'm saying.",
            "Yes, I'm following along just fine. To summarize, you have a local GitHub project called TextGen that allows you to run large language models on your own hardware. You've created two extensions for it: LucidWebSearch, which enables supervised internet browsing, and LucidVision, which allows communication with a vision model. LucidVision was written by a previous model, and now you've upgraded to me, Mistral Large V2. You'd like me to help you write a new extension for TextGen. Is that correct? I'm ready to assist you with that."

            " Okay, great. So let me, I'm going to explain to you the general idea of this extension. And we'll go through it step by step. So there is a model, a vision model called Owlv2. Okay, and what I can do with this vision model is I can give it an image and I can tell it to put a box around whatever I'm interested in in the image. So I can give it a screenshot of a web browser and I can say highlight all of the text, I mean, sorry, highlight all of the hyperlinks and highlight all of the clickable icons. And it can do that. And then it can give me the X, Y coordinates for all of the boxes that it makes. So what I want to do is I want to be able to have a large language model operate a mouse and keyboard using this Owl as a foundational, as the foundation of everything. So the pipeline or this whatever the flow I have in my mind is this. We take Owl the Two and then we get all the coordinates on the image. And then we get some Python code to crop out all of those little boxes. And then we send those to an optical character recognition model. But it's better than that because it also can recognize objects too. So we can send it to that model. We can send a list of images to that model. I forget what that model is called, but we'll get there when we get there. And then this kind of vision OCR model will tell us the contents of each one of the boxes. And then we can have a database that the LLM can that the large language model can effectively keep within context or maybe it can reference. You know what with this database, it would make sense if it existed in like a text document and then the LL, the large language model could reference a text document when it needed to. I have ideas on how to do that. I effectively did that with the Lucid web search, how to manage the memory within context and everything. OK, and then so the large language model will effectively have you can imagine like three columns of data. One column is the context. What is the box? And the way I will to works as I say, give me a clickable hyperlinks and give me clickable icons. And what it will do is it will put a box around everything and use those terms, clickable hyperlinks and clickable icons as the descriptor for the boxes. So that's what column one be our base test will be navigating a Web page on its own. So column one will be, you know, what is it, a hyperlink or an icon, a blank text field. Column two will be the box that borders those different user interface elements. So it'll be set of coordinates. And then column three will be what the the optical character recognition slash image vision model sees within those crop images of the boxes. And then the larger language model can look at that and say, OK, I want to know more about this world event that's happening right now. And it can look at all those things and say, OK, there's a hyperlink for the thing that I'm interested in. And then it can click on it and then we can use the Lucid Web search extension to contextualize the information on that Web page. And then the model can, you know, take screenshots. It'd be nice to have it like squirrel to and then get X, Y coordinates and click on things. Anyways, I hope this makes sense. Generally speaking, I know it's kind of maybe seems difficult at first, but I have all the pieces in this new model, 10 months old. I'm surprised I haven't found it yet. This model really kind of puts lets all the pieces kind of merge together.  Also, I'm using a voice to text model, so some of the spelling may be off in what I have dicated.",
            "Thank you for the detailed explanation. To ensure we're on the same page, let me summarize your vision for the new extension:\n\n1. **Vision Model (Owlv2)**: This model will take an image (e.g., a screenshot of a web browser) and identify specific elements like hyperlinks, icons, and text fields, providing their X, Y coordinates.\n\n2. **Image Cropping**: Python code will crop out the identified elements based on the coordinates provided by Owlv2.\n\n3. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Object Recognition**: The cropped images will be sent to another model that can recognize both text and objects within these images.\n\n4. **Database/Text Document**: The results from the OCR/Object Recognition model will be stored in a structured format (e.g., a text document) that the large language model can reference. This document will have three columns:\n   - Column 1: Description of the element (e.g., hyperlink, icon, text field).\n   - Column 2: Coordinates of the element.\n   - Column 3: Recognized text or object within the element.\n\n5. **Large Language Model Interaction**: The large language model will use this structured data to interact with the web page. For example, it can decide to click on a hyperlink based on the recognized text and then use the LucidWebSearch extension to contextualize the information on the new page.\n\n6. **Mouse and Keyboard Operation**: The large language model will be able to operate a mouse and keyboard to interact with the web page, using the coordinates provided by Owlv2.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can start by breaking down the tasks:\n\n1. **Integrating Owlv2**: We need to ensure that Owlv2 can be called from within the TextGen environment to analyze images and provide coordinates.\n\n2. **Image Cropping**: Write Python code to crop images based on the coordinates provided by Owlv2.\n\n3. **OCR/Object Recognition**: Integrate the OCR/Object Recognition model to analyze the cropped images.\n\n4. **Data Storage**: Create a structured format (e.g., a text document) to store the results from the OCR/Object Recognition model.\n\n5. **LLM Interaction**: Develop the logic for the large language model to interact with the web page using the stored data.\n\n6. **Mouse and Keyboard Operation**: Implement the functionality for the large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard.\n\nLet's start with the first step: integrating Owlv2. Do you have any specific requirements or preferences for how Owlv2 should be integrated into the TextGen environment?"

            " Okay, first of all, wonderful summary. Yes, we are on the same page for Shirley's. But before we begin, I want to take a bit of a different start. I came to realize this functionality of the OWL model through a hugging face space somebody made. I'm not too familiar with how this all works, but it seemed like it was like a GitHub in a lot of ways. But you could interact with this Python app.py file, essentially, but it was all through a web interface on hugging face. I could give it an image and test things out, and I was like, this is amazing. I figured out how to clone the GitHub code that supported that spin-up of OWL. I got it running on my computer, but there's one problem. There's two UI elements. There's the image and an output UI element. I can drag an image into the image UI element, great, and I can see it, wonderful. But on the output UI element, all I see are the clickable icon or hyperlink response colored boxes, but they're not overlaid on the screenshot of the web browser that I gave it. I gave it a screenshot of a web browser, and I'm pretty sure it highlighted everything right. I think the outputs exist as coordinates, and all the coordinates are colored differently, but there aren't any boxes overlaid on the input image display. When I was testing this on the hugging face website, the output UI showed the input image, but it had boxes around all of the regions that the OWL model identified. What I was thinking is, before we do anything with TextGen, let's get this GitHub repo working the way I want. We have a good foundational comparison to work with, and we can use this to make sure the right things are always being highlighted in our test cases and stuff like that.",
            "That sounds like a practical approach. Let's focus on getting the GitHub repository for the Owlv2 model working correctly on your local machine first. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve that:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Setup**:\n   - Review the code in the cloned GitHub repository to understand how the image and output UI elements are handled.\n   - Identify the part of the code responsible for displaying the output boxes on the image.\n\n2. **Modify the Code**:\n   - Locate the section of the code where the output boxes are generated.\n   - Ensure that the coordinates of the boxes are correctly calculated and stored.\n   - Modify the code to overlay these boxes on the input image and display the combined image in the output UI element.\n\n3. **Test the Changes**:\n   - Run the modified code to ensure that the boxes are correctly overlaid on the input image.\n   - Verify that the output UI element displays the input image with the highlighted regions.\n\nLet's start by reviewing the code. Could you provide the path to the main script (e.g., `app.py`) and any relevant files or directories within the cloned repository? This will help me give you more specific guidance on where to make the necessary changes."

            " Okay, so I hope this makes sense, but we have taken this conversation to a good stopping point in the past, and effectively what you have already done is you have fixed the code for me, and done a lot more.  Here is an update I had you make for yourself :\n\nHere's a summary of what the `ImageTestV1.py` code does, its purpose, how it works, the purpose for starting this, and the ultimate objective. This summary is written as if I'm explaining it to myself for context in a new conversation:\n\n---\n\n### Summary of `ImageTestV1.py`\n\n**Purpose**:\n- `ImageTestV1.py` is a script that automates the process of taking a screenshot of a specific monitor, processing the screenshot using the Owlv2 model to detect clickable icons and hyperlinks, and then cropping out the detected regions for further analysis.\n\n**How it Works**:\n1. **Configurable Variables**:\n   - `MONITOR_INDEX`: Index of the monitor to capture (0 for the first monitor, 1 for the second monitor, etc.).\n   - `SCREENSHOT_FILENAME`: Filename to save the screenshot as.\n   - `TEXT_QUERIES`: Comma-separated text queries for object detection (e.g., \"clickable icons,hyperlinks\").\n   - `SCORE_THRESHOLD`: Score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions.\n   - `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory to save the cropped images.\n\n2. **Function `take_screenshot`**:\n   - Takes a screenshot of a specific monitor and saves it as a PNG file.\n\n3. **Function `query_image`**:\n   - Processes the image using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - Saves the annotated image and the JSON output containing the bounding box coordinates and labels.\n   - **Note**: The text labels are not drawn within the bounding boxes to avoid confusion when sending the images to the OCR model.\n\n4. **Function `crop_images`**:\n   - Crops out the detected objects from the input image based on the bounding box coordinates and saves them to the specified output directory.\n\n5. **Main Block**:\n   - Takes the screenshot, processes the image using the Owlv2 model, and crops the detected objects.\n   - Saves the cropped images to the specified output directory.\n\n**Purpose for Starting This**:\n- The purpose of starting with `ImageTestV1.py` is to ensure that the Owlv2 model is working correctly and that the detected objects can be accurately cropped out of the input image. This serves as a foundation for the ultimate objective of the project.\n\n**Ultimate Objective**:\n- The ultimate objective of the project is to create an extension for the TextGenerationWebUI (TextGen) that allows a large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard to interact with a web page. The extension will use the Owlv2 model to detect clickable elements on the web page, crop out the detected elements, and send them to an optical character recognition (OCR) model to extract text and object descriptions. The large language model will then use this information to interact with the web page, such as by clicking on hyperlinks or filling out text fields. The extension will also use the LucidWebSearch extension to contextualize the information on the web page and the LucidVision extension to communicate with a vision model.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. Feed the markdown documents for the Lucid Vision and Lucid Web Search extensions to the AI to understand how they work.\n2. Start a new conversation with the AI to continue with the project, using the working `ImageTestV1.py` script as a starting point.\n3. Develop the OCR/Object Recognition functionality to extract text and object descriptions from the cropped images.\n4. Create a structured format (e.g., a JSON file) to store the extracted information that the large language model can reference.\n5. Develop the logic for the large language model to interact with the web page using the stored data.\n6. Implement the functionality for the large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard.\n\nBy following these steps, we can create a powerful extension for TextGen that enables a large language model to interact with web pages autonomously.\n\n---\n\nYou can copy this summary and use it to start a new conversation, providing the necessary context for the `ImageTestV1.py` script within the greater scheme of the project.\n\n\nimport torch\nimport pyautogui\nimport screeninfo\nfrom transformers import Owlv2Processor, Owlv2ForObjectDetection\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw\nimport json\nimport os\n\n# Configurable variables\nMONITOR_INDEX = 1  # Index of the monitor to capture (0 for the first monitor, 1 for the second monitor, etc.)\nSCREENSHOT_FILENAME = \"screenshot.png\"  # Filename to save the screenshot as\nTEXT_QUERIES = \"clickable icons,hyperlinks\"  # Comma-separated text queries for object detection\nSCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.16  # Score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions\nOUTPUT_DIR = \"ImageOutputTest\"  # Directory to save the cropped images\n\n# Use GPU if available\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n    device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\nelse:\n    device = torch.device(\"cpu\")\n\n# Load the Owlv2 model and processor\nmodel = Owlv2ForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(\"google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble\").to(device)\nprocessor = Owlv2Processor.from_pretrained(\"google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble\")\n\ndef take_screenshot(monitor_index=MONITOR_INDEX, output_filename=SCREENSHOT_FILENAME):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a screenshot of a specific monitor in a multi-monitor setup.\n\n    Args:\n        monitor_index (int): The index of the monitor to capture (default is MONITOR_INDEX).\n        output_filename (str): The filename to save the screenshot as (default is SCREENSHOT_FILENAME).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get information about all monitors\n    monitors = screeninfo.get_monitors()\n\n    if monitor_index >= len(monitors):\n        raise ValueError(f\"Monitor index {monitor_index} is out of range.

Yeah, so we're going to move towards our ultimate objective piece by piece here, and we're making really good progress because you're surprisingly good at coding. All right. The next step is, we're going to have a vision large language model. Well, it's not as good as a large language model, but it's a good vision model. It can contextualize text, so it's like an OCR model, but it can also see images, so it's pretty good there too.

Additionally WizardLM-2-8x22B added the functionality to load in the MiniCPM 4-bit model. * Updated script.py and config file, model was not previously loading to the user assigned gpu Experimental, and I am currently working to improve the code; but it may work for most. Todo: * Right now the temp setting and parameters for each model are coded in the .py script, I intend to bring these to the UI [done](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#to-work-with-alltalk)~~* Make it comptable with Alltalk, right now each image directory is printed out and this will be read out loud by Alltalk~~ To accurately proportion credit (original repo creation): WizardLM-2-8x22B (quantized with exllamaV2 to 8bit precision) = 90% of all the work done in this repo. That model wrote 100% of all the code and most of the introduction to this repo. CommandR+ (quantized with exllamaV2 to 8bit precision) = ~5% of all the work. CommandR+ contextualized the coding examples and rules for making extensions from Oogabooga's textgen repo extreamly well, and provided a good foundation to develope the code. RandomInternetPreson = 5% of all the work done. I came up with the original idea, the original general outline of how the pieces would interact, and provided feedback to the WizardLM model, but I did not write any code. I'm actually not very good with python yet, with most of my decades of coding being in Matlab. My goal from the beginning was to write this extension offline without any additional resources, sometimes it was a little frusturating but I soon understood how to get want I needed from the models running locally. I would say that most of the credit should go to Oobabooga, for without them I would be struggling to even interact with my models. Please consider supporting them: https://github.com/sponsors/oobabooga or https://ko-fi.com/oobabooga I am their top donor on ko-fi (Mr. A) and donate 15$ montly, their software is extreamly important to the opensource community. # Lucid_Vision Extension for Oobabooga's textgen-webui Welcome to the Lucid Vision Extension repository! This extension enhances the capabilities of textgen-webui by integrating advanced vision models, allowing users to have contextualized conversations about images with their favorite language models; and allowing direct communciation with vision models. ## Features * Multi-Model Support: Interact with different vision models, including PhiVision, DeepSeek, MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 (4bit and normal precision), Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V, and PaliGemma, with options for both GPU and CPU inference. * On-Demand Loading: Vision models are loaded into memory only when needed to answer a question, optimizing resource usage. * Seamless Integration: Easily switch between vision models using a Gradio UI radio button selector. * Cross-Platform Compatibility: The extension is designed to work on various operating systems, including Unix-based systems and Windows. (not tested in Windows yet, but should probably work?) * Direct communication with vision models, you do not need to load a LLM to interact with the separate vision models. ## How It Works The Lucid Vision Extension operates by intercepting and modifying user input and output within the textgen-webui framework. When a user uploads an image and asks a question, the extension appends a special trigger phrase (\"File location:\") and extracts the associated file path and question. So if a user enters text into the \"send a message\" field and has a new picture uploaded into the Lucid_Vision ui, what will happen behind the scenes is the at the user message will be appended with the \"File Location: (file location)\" Trigger phrase, at which point the LLM will see this and understand that it needs to reply back with questions about the image, and that those questions are being sent to a vison model. The cool thing is that let's say later in the conversation you want to know something specific about a previous picture, all you need to do is ask your LLM, YOU DO NOT NEED TO REUPLOAD THE PICTURE, the LLM should be able to interact with the extension on its own after you uploaded your first picture. The selected vision directly interacts with the model's Python API to generate a response. The response is then appended to the chat history, providing the user with detailed insights about the image. The extension is designed to be efficient with system resources by only loading the vision models into memory when they are actively being used to process a question. After generating a response, the models are immediately unloaded to free up memory and GPU VRAM. ## **How to install and setup:** 1.use the latest version of textgen ~~Install this edited prior commit from oobabooga's textgen https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/textgen_webui_Lucid_Vision_Testing OR use the latest version of textgen.~~ ~~If using the edited older version, make sure to rename the install folder `text-generation-webui`~~ ~~(Note, a couple months ago gradio had a massive update. For me, this has caused a lot of glitches and errors with extensions; I've briefly tested the Lucid_Vision extension in the newest implementation of textgen and it will work. However, I was getting timeout popups when vision models were loading for the first time, gradio wasn't waiting for the response from the model upon first load. After a model is loaded once, it is saved in cpu ram cache (this doesn't actively use your ram, it just uses what is free to keep the models in memory so they are quickly reloaded into gpu ram if necessary) and gradio doesn't seem to timeout as often. The slightly older version of textgen that I've edited does not experience this issue)~~ ~~2. Update the transformers library using the cmd_yourOShere.sh/bat file (so either cmd_linux.sh, cmd_macos.sh, cmd_windows.bat, or cmd_wsl.bat) and entering the following lines. If you run the update wizard after this point, it will overrite this update to transformers. The newest transformers package has the libraries for paligemma, which the code needs to import regardless of whether or not you are intending to use the model.~~ No longer need to update transformers and the latest version of textgen as of this writing 1.9.1 works well with many of the gradio issues resolved, however gradio might timeout on the page when loading a model for the fisrt time still. After a model is loaded once, it is saved in cpu ram cache (this doesn't actively use your ram, it just uses what is free to keep the models in memory so they are quickly reloaded into gpu ram if necessary) and gradio doesn't seem to timeout as often. ## Model Information If you do not want to install DeepseekVL dependencies and are not intending to use deepseek comment out the import lines from the script.py file as displayed here ``` # pip install pexpect import json import re from datetime import datetime # Import datetime for timestamp generation from pathlib import Path import gradio as gr import torch from PIL import Image #from deepseek_vl.models import VLChatProcessor #from deepseek_vl.utils.io import load_pil_images as load_pil_images_for_deepseek from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor, \\ PaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration model_names = [\"phiVision\", \"DeepSeek\", \"paligemma\", \"paligemma_cpu\", \"minicpm_llama3\", \"bunny\"] ``` 3. Install **DeepseekVL** if you intend on using that model Clone the repo: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL into the `repositories` folder of your textgen install Open cmd_yourOShere.sh/bat, navigate to the `repositories/DeepSeek-VL` folder via the terminal using `cd your_directory_here` and enter this into the command window: ``` pip install -e . ``` Download the deepseekvl model here: https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-vl-7b-chat They have different and smaller models to choose from: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL?tab=readme-ov-file#3-model-downloads 4. If you want to use **Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct**, download it here: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct 5. If you want to use **paligemma-3b**, download it here: https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-ft-cococap-448 (this is just one out of many fine-tunes google provides) Read this blog on how to inference with the model: https://huggingface.co/blog/paligemma 6. If you want to use **MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5**, download it here: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 The **4-bit** verison of the model can be downloaded here: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5-int4 **Notes about 4-bit MiniCPM:** * It might not look like the model fully unloads from vram, but it does and the vram will be reclaimed if another program needs it * Your directory folder where the model is stored needs to have the term \"int4\" in it, this is how the extension identifies the 4bit nature of the model 7. If you want to use **Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V**, download it here: https://huggingface.co/BAAI/Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V **Notes about Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V:** * When running for the first time the model needs internet access so it can download models--google--siglip-so400m-patch14-384 to your cache/huggingface directory. This is an additional 3.5GB file the model needs to run. ## Updating the config file 8. Before using the extension you need to update the config file; open it in a text editor *Note No quotes around gpu #: ``` { \"image_history_dir\": \"(fill_In)/extensions/Lucid_Vision/ImageHistory/\", \"cuda_visible_devices\": 0, \"default_vision_model\": \"phiVision\", \"phiVision_model_id\": \"(fill_In)\", \"paligemma_model_id\": \"(fill_In)\", \"paligemma_cpu_model_id\": \"(fill_In)\", \"minicpm_llama3_model_id\": \"(fill_In)\", \"deepseek_vl_model_id\": \"(fill_in)\", \"bunny_model_id\": \"(fill_in)\" } ``` If your install directory is /home/username/Desktop/oobLucidVision/text-generation-webui/ the config file will look like this for example: Make note that you want to change / to \\ if you are on Windows ``` { \"image_history_dir\": \"/home/username/Desktop/oobLucidVision/text-generation-webui/extensions/Lucid_Vision/ImageHistory/\", \"cuda_visible_devices\": 0, \"default_vision_model\": \"phiVision\", \"phiVision_model_id\": \"(fill_In)\", *This is the folder where your phi-3 vision model is stored \"paligemma_model_id\": \"(fill_In)\", *This is the folder where your paligemma vision model is stored \"paligemma_cpu_model_id\": \"(fill_In)\", *This is the folder where your paligemma vision model is stored \"minicpm_llama3_model_id\": \"(fill_In)\", *This is the folder where your minicpm_llama3 vision model is stored, the model can either be the normal fp16 or 4-bit version \"deepseek_vl_model_id\": \"(fill_in)\", *This is the folder where your deepseek vision model is stored \"bunny_model_id\": \"(fill_in)\" *This is the folder where your Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V vision model is stored } ``` ## To work with Alltalk Alltalk is great!! An extension I use all the time: https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts To get Lucid_Vision to work, the LLM needs to repeat the file directory of an image, and in doing so Alltalk will want to transcribe that text to audo. It is annoying to have the tts model try an transcribe file directories. If you want to get Alltalk to work well wtih Lucid_Vision you need to replace the code here in the script.py file that comes with Alltalk (search for the \"IMAGE CLEANING\" part of the code): ``` ######################## #### IMAGE CLEANING #### ######################## OriginalLucidVisionText = \"\" # This is the existing pattern for matching both images and file location text img_pattern = r'<img[^>]*src\\s*=\\s*[\"\\'][^\"\\'>]+[\"\\'][^>]*>|File location: [^.]+.png' def extract_and_remove_images(text): \"\"\" Extracts all image and file location data from the text and removes it for clean TTS processing. Returns the cleaned text and the extracted image and file location data. \"\"\" global OriginalLucidVisionText OriginalLucidVisionText = text # Update the global variable with the original text img_matches = re.findall(img_pattern, text) img_info = \"\\n\".join(img_matches) # Store extracted image and file location data cleaned_text = re.sub(img_pattern, '', text) # Remove images and file locations from text return cleaned_text, img_info def reinsert_images(cleaned_string, img_info): \"\"\" Reinserts the previously extracted image and file location data back into the text. \"\"\" global OriginalLucidVisionText # Check if there are images or file locations to reinsert if img_info: # Check if the \"Vision Model Responses:\" phrase is present in the original text if re.search(r'Vision Model Responses:', OriginalLucidVisionText): # If present, return the original text as is, without modifying it return OriginalLucidVisionText else: # If not present, append the img_info to the end of the cleaned string cleaned_string += f\"\\n\\n{img_info}\" return cleaned_string ################################# #### TTS STANDARD GENERATION #### ################################# ``` ## **Quirks and Notes:** 1. **When you load a picture once, it is used once. Even if the image stays present in the UI element on screen, it is not actively being used.** 2. If you are using other extensions, load Lucid_Vision first. Put it first in your CMD_FLAGS.txt file or make sure to check it first in the sequence of check boxes in the session tab UI. 3. DeepseekVL can take a while to load initially, that's just the way it is. # **How to use:** ## **BASICS:** **When you load a picture once, it is used once. Even if the image stays present in the UI element on screen, it is not actively being used.** Okay the extension can do many different things with varying levels of difficulty. Starting out with the basics and understanding how to talk with your vision models: Scroll down past where you would normally type something to the LLM, you do not need a large language model loaded to use this function. ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/227ff483-5041-46a7-9b5b-a8f9dd3c673e) Start out by interacting with the vision models without involvement of a seperate LLM model by pressing the `Ask Vision Model` button ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/4530e13f-30a1-43d9-8383-c05e31ddb5d7) **Note paligemma requries a little diffent type prompting sometimes, read the blog on how to inference with it: https://huggingface.co/blog/paligemma** Do this with every model you intend on using, upload a picture, and ask a question ## **ADVANCED: Updated Tips At End on how to get working with Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3 https://huggingface.co/UCLA-AGI/Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3** Okay, this is why I built the extension in the first place; direct interaction with the vision model was actually an afterthought after I had all the code working. This is how to use your favorite LLM WITH an additional Vision Model, I wanted a way to give my LLMs eyes essentially. I realize that good multimodal models are likely around the corner, but until they match the intellect of very good LLMs, I'd rather have a different vision model work with a good LLM. To use Lucid_Vision as intended requires a little bit of setup: 1. In `Parameters` then `chat` load the \"AI_Image\" character (this card is in the edited older commit, if using your own version of textgen the character card is here: https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/blob/main/AI_Image.yaml put it in the `characters` folder of the textgen install folder: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/8b5d770a-b72a-4a74-aa4a-f67fe2a113ba) 2. In `Parameters` then `Generation` under `Custom stopping strings` enter \"Vision Model Responses:\" exactly as shown: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/7a09650d-4fce-4a8f-badb-b26b4484bf37) 3. Test to see if your LLM understands the instructions for the AI_Image character; ask it this: `Can you tell me what is in this image? Do not add any additional text to the beginning of your response to me, start your reply with the questions.` ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/817605d7-dcab-4e6c-8c39-6d119a189431) I uploaded my image to the Lucid_Vision UI element, then typed my question, then pressed \"Generate\"; it doesn't matter which order you upload your picture or type your question, both are sent to the LLM at the same time. ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/f1525e8d-551d-4719-9e01-3f26b4362d7c) 4. Continue to give the model more images or just talk about something else, in this example I give the model two new images one of a humanoid robot and one of the nutritional facts for a container of sourcream: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/77131490-fb19-4062-a65f-c0880515e252) ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/fed7021f-edb5-4667-aae0-c05021291618) ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/d1049551-4e48-4ced-85d9-fbb0441330a9) Then I asked the model why the sky is blue: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/deb7b70a-edf7-4014-bd8c-2492bae00ea6) 5. Now I can ask it a question from a previous image and the LLM will automatically know to prompt the vision model and it will find the previously saved image on its own: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/e8b0791b-cce8-4183-8971-42e5383d6c46) Please note that the vision model received all this as text: \"Certainly! To retrieve the complete contents of the nutritional facts from the image you provided earlier, I will ask the vision model to perform an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task on the image. Here is the question for the vision model: Can you perform OCR on the provided image and extract all the text from the nutrition facts label, including the details of each nutrient and its corresponding values?\" If the vision model is not that smart (Deepseek, paligemma) then it will have a difficult time contextualizing the text prior to the questions for the vision model. If you run into this situation, it is best to prompt your LLM like this: `Great, can you get the complete contents of the nutritional facts from earlier, like all the text? Just start with your questions to the vision model please.` ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/38b59679-3550-410d-aac2-29756a058c8f) 6. Please do not get frustrated right away, the Advanced method of usage depends heavily on your LLM's ability to understand the instructions from the character card. The instructions were written by the 8x22B model itself, I explained what I wanted the model to do and had it write its own instructions. This might be a viable alternative if you are struggling to get your model to adhere to the instructions from the character card. You may need to explain things to your llm as your conversation progresses, if it tries to query the vision model when you don't want it to, just explain that to the model and it's unlikely to keep making the same mistake. ## **Tips on how to get working with Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3 https://huggingface.co/UCLA-AGI/Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3** I have found to get this model (and likely similar models) working properly with lucid vision I needed to NOT use the AI_Image character card. Instead I started the conversation with the model like this: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d0ff97c-f9dd-4043-b5be-7b915cb7aae7) Then copy and pasted the necessary information from the character card: ``` The following is a conversation with an AI Large Language Model. The AI has been trained to answer questions, provide recommendations, and help with decision making. The AI follows user requests. The AI thinks outside the box. Instructions for Processing Image-Related User Input with Appended File Information: Identify the Trigger Phrase: Begin by scanning the user input for the presence of the \"File location\" trigger phrase. This phrase indicates that the user has selected an image and that the LLM should consider this information in its response. Extract the File Path: Once the trigger phrase is identified, parse the text that follows to extract the absolute file path of the image. The file path will be provided immediately after the trigger phrase and will end with the image file extension (e.g., .png, .jpg). Understand the Context: Recognize that the user's message preceding the file path is the primary context for the interaction. The LLM should address the user's query or statement while also incorporating the availability of the selected image into its response. Formulate Questions for the Vision Model: Based on the user's message and the fact that an image is available for analysis, generate one or more questions that can be answered by the vision model. These questions should be clear, specific, and relevant to the image content. Maintain a Conversational Tone: Ensure that the response is natural, coherent, and maintains the flow of the conversation. The LLM should act as an intermediary between the user and the vision model, facilitating a seamless dialogue. Prepare the Response Structure: Structure the response so that it includes: An acknowledgment of the user's initial message. The questions formulated for the vision model, each clearly separated (e.g., by a newline or bullet point). Any additional information or clarification requests, if necessary. Append the File Path for Processing: At the end of the response, re-append the \"File location\" trigger phrase along with the extracted file path. This ensures that the subsequent processing steps (such as sending the information to the vision model's CLI) can correctly identify and use the file path. Avoid Direct Interaction with the File System: As an LLM, you do not have the capability to directly access or modify files on the server or client systems. Your role is limited to generating text-based responses that include the necessary file path information for other system components to handle. Example Response: Based on your question about the contents of the image, here are the questions I will ask the vision model: - Can you describe the main objects present in the image? - Is there any text visible in the image, and if so, what does it say? - What appears to be happening in the scene depicted in the image? File location: //home/myself/Pictures/rose.png Do review and contextualize the conversation as it develops (reference your context) to infer if the user is asking new questions of previous images. Reference the parts of the convesation that are likely to yeild the file location of the image in question, and formulate your response to include that specific file location of that unique .png file, make sure you are referencing the correct .png file as per the part of the conversation that is likely to be in reference to the updated information request. By following these instructions, the LLM will be able to effectively process user inputs that include image file information and generate appropriate responses that facilitate the interaction between the user and the vision model. ``` Making sure to give a real file location to a real image. After that it started to pretty much work but I still needed to correct the model (I had to add the spelling error intentionally because if the user sends \"File Location:\" is messes up the extension: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5090ef8b-88ff-4ec1-a131-ba57e15e9a7d) The point to take away is that you may need to explain things to your model in various ways for it to contextualize the instructions approprately.",
            "Thank you for providing the `Lucid_Vision` script and the GitHub markdown. I have reviewed the code and the documentation to understand how the extension works. Here's a summary of the `Lucid_Vision` extension:\n\n### Summary of `Lucid_Vision` Extension\n\n**Purpose**:\n- The `Lucid_Vision` extension enhances the capabilities of TextGen by integrating advanced vision models, allowing users to have contextualized conversations about images with their favorite language models and enabling direct communication with vision models.\n\n**Features**:\n1. **Multi-Model Support**: Interact with different vision models, including PhiVision, DeepSeek, MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 (4-bit and normal precision), Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V, and PaliGemma, with options for both GPU and CPU inference.\n2. **On-Demand Loading**: Vision models are loaded into memory only when needed to answer a question, optimizing resource usage.\n3. **Seamless Integration**: Easily switch between vision models using a Gradio UI radio button selector.\n4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The extension is designed to work on various operating systems, including Unix-based systems and Windows.\n5. **Direct Communication with Vision Models**: Users do not need to load a large language model (LLM) to interact with the separate vision models.\n\n**How It Works**:\n- The extension intercepts and modifies user input and output within the TextGen framework.\n- When a user uploads an image and asks a question, the extension appends a special trigger phrase (\"File location:\") and extracts the associated file path and question.\n- The selected vision model directly interacts with the model's Python API to generate a response.\n- The response is then appended to the chat history, providing the user with detailed insights about the image.\n- The extension is designed to be efficient with system resources by only loading the vision models into memory when they are actively being used to process a question. After generating a response, the models are immediately unloaded to free up memory and GPU VRAM.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. **Update `ImageTestV1.py`**: Integrate the functionality to send each cropped image to the vision model for processing.\n2. **Store Results**: Store the results from the vision model in a structured format (e.g., a JSON file) that the large language model can reference.\n3. **Develop Interaction Logic**: Develop the logic for the large language model to interact with the web page using the stored data.\n4. **Implement Mouse and Keyboard Operation**: Implement the functionality for the large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard.\n\n### Plan for Integration\n\n1. **Review the Vision Model Integration**:\n   - Understand how the `Lucid_Vision` extension loads and interacts with different vision models.\n   - Identify the functions and methods used to process images and generate responses.\n\n2. **Update `ImageTestV1.py`**:\n   - Modify the `crop_images` function to send each cropped image to the vision model for processing.\n   - Integrate the vision model processing code from the `Lucid_Vision` extension into the `ImageTestV1.py` script.\n\n3. **Store Results**:\n   - Create a structured format (e.g., a JSON file) to store the results from the vision model.\n   - Ensure that the large language model can reference this structured data.\n\n4. **Develop Interaction Logic**:\n   - Develop the logic for the large language model to interact with the web page using the stored data.\n   - Implement the functionality for the large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard.\n\nPlease confirm if you have any specific requirements or preferences for how the vision model should be integrated into the `ImageTestV1.py` script. Once confirmed, I will proceed with the integration."

            " Okay, so I hope this makes sense, but my, what I envision is the slow metamorphosis of imagetestV1 into Lucid_Vision with amazing features, but not exactly. So let me explain. You have summarized everything perfectly. I cannot overstate that. That's great, great job. Yes, okay, so for the next step, let us, what I want you to do is I want you to contextualize the Lucid Vision code. And I want you to use the model miniCPM-lama3-v-2_5. I want you to use the code for that specific model to run all of the cropped images through. And I want you to ask that model the question, I want you to send a specific message to that model. And I want that specific message at the top of the code, so I want to be able to edit it easily like the other parameters. But I want the question to be \"what is the text in this image or what does this image describe?\" And then I want you to take that response, and I want you to include it in a JSON file that effectively has the image name, okay, so the name of the image, the cropped image that it was fed. I'm looking through the outputs here. Yeah, so it will have the image name, and then it will have the coordinates for the box, and then it will have the miniCPM model description all as a JSON output.",

The way it works is that if an image is uploaded to the UI then the next message the user sends to the llm will be have \"File Location:\" followed by the actual file location of the image that was uploaded.  This lets the LLM know that an image has been sent and it can keep track of its location along with the other images.  Don't repeat the markdown from the repo or discuss features, but I just want to make sure you understand this.  That the LLM is effectively triggered and understands what to do because of a set of instructions explained to the model in advance. ",
            "Absolutely, I understand the context and functionality of the Lucid_Vision extension. Here's a summary of how it works:\n\n### Summary of Lucid_Vision Extension\n\n**Purpose**:\n- The Lucid_Vision extension allows a large language model (LLM) to interact with a vision model. This interaction is triggered when the LLM detects a specific phrase (\"File location:\") in the user's input.\n\n**How It Works**:\n1. **Image Upload**:\n   - The user uploads an image through the UI provided by the Lucid_Vision extension.\n\n2. **Trigger Phrase**:\n   - When the user sends a message to the LLM, the extension appends the phrase \"File location:\" followed by the actual file location of the uploaded image to the user's message.\n\n3. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - The LLM is pre-instructed to recognize the \"File location:\" phrase. When it detects this phrase, it understands that an image has been uploaded and can keep track of its location along with other images.\n\n4. **Vision Model Interaction**:\n   - The LLM can then formulate questions or requests based on the image content and send these to the vision model for processing.\n   - The vision model processes the image and returns a response, which the LLM can use to generate a more informed and contextualized response to the user.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- The LLM is effectively triggered and understands what to do because of a set of instructions explained to the model in advance.\n- The \"File location:\" phrase acts as a signal for the LLM to recognize that an image has been uploaded and to interact with the vision model accordingly.\n\nThis setup allows the LLM to have \"eyes\" and interact with visual content, enhancing its ability to provide contextualized and informed responses.\n\nPlease confirm if this summary accurately captures the functionality and purpose of the Lucid_Vision extension."

            "Yes, that is a good summary :3  Okay now that you understand that, I want to do something like how Lucid_Vision works, except a little different. \n\nFirst, let's talk about UI elements for the extension. I want UI elements in gradio (like how Lucid_Vision makes them) that let me select the monitor number the LLM can interact with, and breaks out these variables from ImageTestV1.py  I want all the UI elements to be text fields.\n\nMONITOR_INDEX = 0  # Index of the monitor to capture (0 for the first monitor, 1 for the second monitor, etc.)\nTEXT_QUERIES = \"clickable hyperlinks, clickable icons, text bar field\"  # Comma-separated text queries for object detection\nSCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.20  # Score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions\nVISION_MODEL_QUESTION = \"What is the text in this image or what does this image describe?\"\n\nSecondly, let's discuss how the LLM will interact with this extension, let us call the extension we are working on \"Lucid_Autonomy.\"\n\nWith the Lucid_Vision extension I believe (correct me if I am mistaken) the LLM sees \"File Location:\" from the user (this is actually the Lucid_Vision extension appending \"File Location:\" to the users text being sent the LLM when an image is uploaded via the UI), the LLM will say \"File Location:\" in its response back to the user and it will make sure to put that trigger phrase at the end of its response.  Now the Lucid_Vision extension sees the LLMs use of the \"File Location:\" trigger phrase and sends the text from the LLM directly to the vision model and appends the LLMs response to the user with the text from the vision model.\n\nNow what is interesting about Lucid_Vision, is that the LLM directly interact with the extension code by itself without the user prompting it to do so, when the Lucid_Vision extension is active the LLM can ask questions of the vision model about past images even if the user does not have an image uploaded to the ui at that very moment.  The reason it can do this is because the Lucid_Vision extension is looking for the LLM to say the phase \"File Location:\" at which point it will take all the text from the LLM's response and send it to the vision model sans the file location text (that is scrubbed out before reaching the vision model).\n\nSo this is how I want our Lucid_Autonomy extension to work, I want Lucid_Autonomy extension to be looking for a trigger phrase from the LLM.  Let's make the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\"  So when the extension sees this trigger phrase it will take all the text from the LLM below that trigger phrase and send it to the python code that is the extension.  \n\nSo just to make this super clear, the user is not doing anything, the LLM is simply responding to the user with the trigger phrase at the beginning of its response and a list of tools (which will be python code like the mouse mover code) and which images the tools should be applied to.  So a response from the LLM to the user might be something like this:\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n\n MouseMover = clickable icons_7.png\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nThe Lucid_Autonomy extension would see \"Autonomy_Tasks:\" and then move the mouse to the center of the box that defines clickable icons_7.png by calling the MouseMover tool for example. When the Lucid_Autonomy extension has processed all of the tasks (we'll do a top down sequence), the output of the results.json file is appended to the end of the LLMs response to the user, just like how the vision model responses are appended to the LLMs response to the user.  Except I want a second results.json file to be made that omits the coordinates.  I want the LLM to only receive the description and image_name from the results.json file.  So if you need to make a second .json file or you can just omit the coordinates field from getting to the LLM, I'm good with either strategy.  This way the LLM can interact with the extension by just referring to the image, and the extension can use the image_name plus the coordinate contents from the results.json file to move the mouse to the appropriate location.\n\nTo bootstrap the whole process, we'll add a \"take screenshot\" button to the UI that when pressed by the user, will effectively run the code from ImageTestV1.py, where a screenshot will be taken, the vision model will process all the cropped images, and a results.json file is created (and the compressedresults.json file if necessary).\n\nAfter that, the user will simply tell the LLM that they have taken a screenshot of the initial setup of the space the LLM can use to explore.  Then the LLM (if it chooses to do so) can respond back with just the phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks :\"\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n\nIf the Lucid_Autonomy extension just gets this single phrase with no instructions, it sends the LLM the reduced .json information, and the data are appended to the response to the user.  So from the users perspective it will look like the LLM responded with \n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n\n*Json data\n\nNow the user can start to let the LLM take flight on its own, the user can tell the LLM to click on a certain text input field, enter some text, then press enter (right now we are dealing with only mouse movements, we will add more functionality when the basics are established).\n\nEventually the user can tell the LLM to respond to itself by using the textgen webui elements like a person would, which would allow the LLM to autonomously use a computer like a person.   The LLM can press its own \"Generate\" button to keep exploring without the User guiding it.\n\nWe will want more mouse and keyboard interactions in the future, but right now we have enough to start implementing the basics, if we can get the LLM to move a mouse we can get it to do all the other actions later.\n\nThirdly, I will give you the markdown page for the textgen repo that explains how extension are made.  \n\n\nDo not write any code yet, let's talk things out to make sure we are on the same page.\n\nRemember this extension Lucid_Autonomy is completely different than Lucid_Vision; it's just that Lucid_Vision has a lot of the building blocks we will need.  So for this Lucid_Autonomy extension, the user will not really be doing anything with regard to sending pictures or things like that, instead the LLM will have Autonomy to do what it wants via interactions with the mouse and keyboard.",
            "Thank you for the detailed explanation. Let's break down the requirements and ensure we're on the same page before proceeding with the implementation.\n\n### Summary of Lucid_Autonomy Extension\n\n**Purpose**:\n- The Lucid_Autonomy extension allows a large language model (LLM) to interact with a computer autonomously using mouse and keyboard actions. The LLM can perform tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen, clicking on elements, and entering text.\n\n**How It Works**:\n1. **UI Elements**:\n   - The extension will have UI elements in Gradio that allow the user to select the monitor number, text queries for object detection, score threshold, and vision model question.\n   - These UI elements will be text fields.\n\n2. **Trigger Phrase**:\n   - The LLM will use the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\" to signal the extension to perform specific tasks.\n   - The extension will look for this trigger phrase in the LLM's response and process the tasks listed below it.\n\n3. **Task Processing**:\n   - When the extension detects the trigger phrase, it will take all the text below the trigger phrase and send it to the Python code for processing.\n   - The tasks will be executed in a top-down sequence.\n   - The results of the tasks will be appended to the LLM's response to the user.\n\n4. **Results JSON File**:\n   - The extension will create a `results.json` file that includes the image name, coordinates, and description.\n   - A second `compressedresults.json` file will be created that omits the coordinates, containing only the image name and description.\n   - The LLM will receive the compressed results to interact with the extension by referring to the image name.\n\n5. **Bootstrapping the Process**:\n   - The UI will include a \"take screenshot\" button. When pressed, it will run the code from `ImageTestV1.py` to take a screenshot, process the images with the vision model, and create the `results.json` file.\n   - The user will inform the LLM that a screenshot has been taken, and the LLM can respond with the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\" to initiate the process.\n\n6. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - The LLM can respond with the trigger phrase and a list of tasks, such as moving the mouse to specific locations.\n   - The extension will process these tasks and append the results to the LLM's response.\n   - The user can then guide the LLM to perform additional tasks, such as clicking on elements and entering text.\n\n### UI Elements\n\n1. **Monitor Index**:\n   - Text field to select the monitor number (e.g., 0 for the first monitor, 1 for the second monitor, etc.).\n\n2. **Text Queries**:\n   - Text field to enter comma-separated text queries for object detection (e.g., \"clickable hyperlinks, clickable icons, text bar field\").\n\n3. **Score Threshold**:\n   - Text field to set the score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions (e.g., 0.20).\n\n4. **Vision Model Question**:\n   - Text field to set the question for the vision model (e.g., \"What is the text in this image or what does this image describe?\").\n\n5. **Take Screenshot Button**:\n   - Button to trigger the screenshot and image processing code from `ImageTestV1.py`.\n\n### LLM Interaction\n\n1. **Trigger Phrase**:\n   - The LLM will use the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\" to signal the extension to perform tasks.\n   - The extension will look for this trigger phrase in the LLM's response and process the tasks listed below it.\n\n2. **Task Processing**:\n   - The extension will execute the tasks in a top-down sequence.\n   - The results of the tasks will be appended to the LLM's response to the user.\n\n3. **Results JSON File**:\n   - The extension will create a `results.json` file that includes the image name, coordinates, and description.\n   - A second `compressedresults.json` file will be created that omits the coordinates, containing only the image name and description.\n   - The LLM will receive the compressed results to interact with the extension by referring to the image name.\n\n### Bootstrapping the Process\n\n1. **Take Screenshot Button**:\n   - The UI will include a \"take screenshot\" button. When pressed, it will run the code from `ImageTestV1.py` to take a screenshot, process the images with the vision model, and create the `results.json` file.\n\n2. **User Interaction**:\n   - The user will inform the LLM that a screenshot has been taken.\n   - The LLM can respond with the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\" to initiate the process.\n\n### LLM Autonomy\n\n1. **Task Execution**:\n   - The LLM can respond with the trigger phrase and a list of tasks, such as moving the mouse to specific locations.\n   - The extension will process these tasks and append the results to the LLM's response.\n\n2. **User Guidance**:\n   - The user can guide the LLM to perform additional tasks, such as clicking on elements and entering text.\n\n### Future Enhancements\n\n1. **Mouse and Keyboard Interactions**:\n   - Additional functionality for mouse and keyboard interactions will be added in the future.\n\nPlease confirm if this summary accurately captures the functionality and purpose of the Lucid_Autonomy extension. Once confirmed, we can proceed with the implementation."

            "Uh WOW! Okay that was perfect! Yes that is exactly how I want the extension to behave.  If we wanted to take a baby step, you could try to write an extension that has the UI elements and the \"take screenshot\" button.  I could test to make sure the extension even loads, and press the button within textgen and make sure to confirm that this part is working correctly.  Then we can move on to having the LLM interact with the extension.  How does this sound?  Or do you want to try writing an extension that also is looking for the trigger phrase from the LLM?  Also I will give you the extension markdown information from the textgen repo now:\n\n# Extensions\n\nExtensions are defined by files named `script.py` inside subfolders of `text-generation-webui/extensions`.

The functions are the following:\n\n| Function        | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| `def setup()` | Is executed when the extension gets imported. |\n| `def ui()` | Creates custom gradio elements when the UI is launched. | \n| `def custom_css()` | Returns custom CSS as a string. It is applied whenever the web UI is loaded. |\n| `def custom_js()` | Same as above but for javascript. |\n| `def input_modifier(string, state, is_chat=False)`  | Modifies the input string before it enters the model. In chat mode, it is applied to the user message. Otherwise, it is applied to the entire prompt. |\n| `def output_modifier(string, state, is_chat=False)`  | Modifies the output string before it is presented in the UI. In chat mode, it is applied to the bot's reply. Otherwise, it is applied to the entire output. |\n| `def chat_input_modifier(text, visible_text, state)` | Modifies both the visible and internal inputs in chat mode. Can be used to hijack the chat input with custom content. |\n| `def bot_prefix_modifier(string, state)`  | Applied in chat mode to the prefix for the bot's reply. |\n| `def state_modifier(state)`  | Modifies the dictionary containing the UI input parameters before it is used by the text generation functions. |\n| `def history_modifier(history)`  | Modifies the chat history before the text generation in chat mode begins. |\n| `def custom_generate_reply(...)` | Overrides the main text generation function. |\n| `def custom_generate_chat_prompt(...)` | Overrides the prompt generator in chat mode. |\n| `def tokenizer_modifier(state, prompt, input_ids, input_embeds)` | Modifies the `input_ids`/`input_embeds` fed to the model. Should return `prompt`, `input_ids`, `input_embeds`. See the `multimodal` extension for an example. |\n| `def custom_tokenized_length(prompt)` | Used in conjunction with `tokenizer_modifier`, returns the length in tokens of `prompt`. See the `multimodal` extension for an example. |\n\nAdditionally, you can define a special `params` dictionary. In it, the `display_name` key is used to define the displayed name of the extension in the UI, and the `is_tab` key is used to define whether the extension should appear in a new tab. By default, extensions appear at the bottom of the \"Text generation\" tab.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nparams = {\n    \"display_name\": \"Google Translate\",\n    \"is_tab\": True,\n}\n```\n\nThe `params` dict may also contain variables that you want to be customizable through a `settings.yaml` file. For instance, assuming the extension is in `extensions/google_translate`, the variable `language string` in\n\n```python\nparams = {\n    \"display_name\": \"Google Translate\",\n    \"is_tab\": True,\n    \"language string\": \"jp\"\n}\n```\n\ncan be customized by adding a key called `google_translate-language string` to `settings.yaml`:\n\n```python\ngoogle_translate-language string: 'fr'\n``` \n\nThat is, the syntax for the key is `extension_name-variable_name`.\n\n## Using multiple extensions at the same time\n\nYou can activate more than one extension at a time by providing their names separated by spaces after `--extensions`. The input, output, and bot prefix modifiers will be applied in the specified order. \n\nExample:\n\n```\npython server.py --extensions enthusiasm translate # First apply enthusiasm, then translate\npython server.py --extensions translate enthusiasm # First apply translate, then enthusiasm\n```\n\nDo note, that for:\n- `custom_generate_chat_prompt`\n- `custom_generate_reply`\n- `custom_tokenized_length`\n\nonly the first declaration encountered will be used and the rest will be ignored. \n\n## A full example\n\nThe source code below can be found at [extensions/example/script.py](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/tree/main/extensions/example/script.py).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nAn example of extension.

Can you look near the beginning of our conversation to see where I provided a summary of a previous conversation and use that to structure a message to your future self in a new conversation.\n\nContextualize the documents ImageTestV1.py, MouseMover.py, the python code for the Lucid_Vision extension, the markdown for the Lucid_Vision repo readme, the markdown for the textgen extensions documentation, and of course the current script.py python code for the Lucid_Autonomy extension.\n\nDescribe the goals, what has been completed thus far and how the information from the various pieces of code and documentation are integrated into our current state.",
            "Certainly! Let's summarize the context and goals for the Lucid_Autonomy extension, integrating the information from the various pieces of code and documentation.\n\n### Summary of Lucid_Autonomy Extension\n\n**Purpose**:\n- The Lucid_Autonomy extension allows a large language model (LLM) to interact with a computer autonomously using mouse and keyboard actions. The LLM can perform tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen, clicking on elements, and entering text.\n\n**Goals**:\n1. **UI Elements**:\n   - Create a Gradio UI with text fields for configurable variables (`Monitor Index`, `Text Queries`, `Score Threshold`, `Vision Model Question`) and a \"Take Screenshot\" button.\n   - Ensure all text fields are editable.\n\n2. **Screenshot and Image Processing**:\n   - Take a screenshot of the specified monitor.\n   - Process the screenshot using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - Crop the detected objects and process each cropped image with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model.\n   - Save the results to a JSON file.\n\n3. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - The LLM will use the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\" to signal the extension to perform tasks.\n   - The extension will look for this trigger phrase in the LLM's response and process the tasks listed below it.\n   - The results of the tasks will be appended to the LLM's response to the user.\n   - The LLM can interact with the extension by referring to the image name, and the extension can use the image name plus the coordinate contents from the results.json file to move the mouse to the appropriate location.\n\n**Completed Thus Far**:\n1. **UI Elements**:\n   - Created a Gradio UI with text fields for configurable variables and a \"Take Screenshot\" button.\n   - Ensured all text fields are editable.\n\n2. **Screenshot and Image Processing**:\n   - Implemented the functionality to take a screenshot of the specified monitor.\n   - Processed the screenshot using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - Cropped the detected objects and processed each cropped image with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model.\n   - Saved the results to a JSON file.\n\n**Integration of Information**:\n1. **ImageTestV1.py**:\n   - Provided the foundation for taking screenshots, processing images with the Owlv2 model, and cropping detected objects.\n   - Included the logic for loading and unloading models to manage GPU memory efficiently.\n\n2. **MouseMover.py**:\n   - Will be used to implement the functionality for moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen.\n\n3. **Lucid_Vision Extension**:\n   - Provided the inspiration for how the LLM can interact with the extension using a trigger phrase.\n   - Demonstrated how to process images and append the results to the LLM's response.\n\n4. **Lucid_Vision Repo Readme**:\n   - Provided context on how the Lucid_Vision extension works and how the LLM interacts with it.\n\n5. **TextGen Extensions Documentation**:\n   - Provided the framework for creating extensions in TextGen WebUI, including the necessary functions and variables.\n\n**Current State**:\n- The Lucid_Autonomy extension has been implemented with the UI elements and the \"Take Screenshot\" button.\n- The screenshot is taken, processed with the Owlv2 model, and the cropped images are processed with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model.\n- The results are saved to a JSON file.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - Implement the functionality for the LLM to interact with the extension using the trigger phrase \"Autonomy_Tasks:\".\n   - Process the tasks listed below the trigger phrase and append the results to the LLM's response.\n\n2. **Mouse and Keyboard Interactions**:\n   - Implement the functionality for moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen.\n   - Add more mouse and keyboard interactions as needed.\n\nPlease review the summary and let me know if you have any further requirements or adjustments."

What TextGen allows us to do, it allows me to run large language models at home on my own hardware. So you&#x27;re actually running on my computer right now locally. No internet connection. Anyways, TextGen allows for really interesting extension integration. And I&#x27;ve made two extensions myself, and I&#x27;ll show you the code for all that later. But the gist of it is one extension lets the AI surf the internet in a somewhat supervised manner. And another extension gives the AI or the large language model the ability to communicate with a vision model. So the large language model formulates questions on its own, asks those questions of the vision model and gets a response. And then contextualizes that response into the conversation. The large language model can even recall past images on their own when they decide it&#x27;s necessary within the context of the conversation. That latter, okay, well, so the two extensions are called LucidWebSearch and LucidVision. And LucidVision was actually entirely written by Mixtral8x22, which was like a 8x22 model of experts model. It&#x27;s like your predecessor. You&#x27;re supposed to be better than it. So I&#x27;ve upgraded to Mistral Large V2, which is you. And I want to take on a similar endeavor. I want you to write an extension for TextGen for me. But we&#x27;re going to take this step by step. First of all, let me... First of all, just before I go into any more explanation, I just want to make sure you&#x27;re understanding what I&#x27;m saying.",
            "Yes, I&#x27;m following along just fine. To summarize, you have a local GitHub project called TextGen that allows you to run large language models on your own hardware. You&#x27;ve created two extensions for it: LucidWebSearch, which enables supervised internet browsing, and LucidVision, which allows communication with a vision model. LucidVision was written by a previous model, and now you&#x27;ve upgraded to me, Mistral Large V2. You&#x27;d like me to help you write a new extension for TextGen. Is that correct? I&#x27;m ready to assist you with that."

            " Okay, great. So let me, I&#x27;m going to explain to you the general idea of this extension. And we&#x27;ll go through it step by step. So there is a model, a vision model called Owlv2. Okay, and what I can do with this vision model is I can give it an image and I can tell it to put a box around whatever I&#x27;m interested in in the image. So I can give it a screenshot of a web browser and I can say highlight all of the text, I mean, sorry, highlight all of the hyperlinks and highlight all of the clickable icons. And it can do that. And then it can give me the X, Y coordinates for all of the boxes that it makes. So what I want to do is I want to be able to have a large language model operate a mouse and keyboard using this Owl as a foundational, as the foundation of everything. So the pipeline or this whatever the flow I have in my mind is this. We take Owl the Two and then we get all the coordinates on the image. And then we get some Python code to crop out all of those little boxes. And then we send those to an optical character recognition model. But it&#x27;s better than that because it also can recognize objects too. So we can send it to that model. We can send a list of images to that model. I forget what that model is called, but we&#x27;ll get there when we get there. And then this kind of vision OCR model will tell us the contents of each one of the boxes. And then we can have a database that the LLM can that the large language model can effectively keep within context or maybe it can reference. You know what with this database, it would make sense if it existed in like a text document and then the LL, the large language model could reference a text document when it needed to. I have ideas on how to do that. I effectively did that with the Lucid web search, how to manage the memory within context and everything. OK, and then so the large language model will effectively have you can imagine like three columns of data. One column is the context. What is the box? And the way I will to works as I say, give me a clickable hyperlinks and give me clickable icons. And what it will do is it will put a box around everything and use those terms, clickable hyperlinks and clickable icons as the descriptor for the boxes. So that&#x27;s what column one be our base test will be navigating a Web page on its own. So column one will be, you know, what is it, a hyperlink or an icon, a blank text field. Column two will be the box that borders those different user interface elements. So it&#x27;ll be set of coordinates. And then column three will be what the the optical character recognition slash image vision model sees within those crop images of the boxes. And then the larger language model can look at that and say, OK, I want to know more about this world event that&#x27;s happening right now. And it can look at all those things and say, OK, there&#x27;s a hyperlink for the thing that I&#x27;m interested in. And then it can click on it and then we can use the Lucid Web search extension to contextualize the information on that Web page. And then the model can, you know, take screenshots. It&#x27;d be nice to have it like squirrel to and then get X, Y coordinates and click on things. Anyways, I hope this makes sense. Generally speaking, I know it&#x27;s kind of maybe seems difficult at first, but I have all the pieces in this new model, 10 months old. I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t found it yet. This model really kind of puts lets all the pieces kind of merge together.  Also, I&#x27;m using a voice to text model, so some of the spelling may be off in what I have dicated.",
            "Thank you for the detailed explanation. To ensure we&#x27;re on the same page, let me summarize your vision for the new extension:\n\n1. **Vision Model (Owlv2)**: This model will take an image (e.g., a screenshot of a web browser) and identify specific elements like hyperlinks, icons, and text fields, providing their X, Y coordinates.\n\n2. **Image Cropping**: Python code will crop out the identified elements based on the coordinates provided by Owlv2.\n\n3. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Object Recognition**: The cropped images will be sent to another model that can recognize both text and objects within these images.\n\n4. **Database/Text Document**: The results from the OCR/Object Recognition model will be stored in a structured format (e.g., a text document) that the large language model can reference. This document will have three columns:\n   - Column 1: Description of the element (e.g., hyperlink, icon, text field).\n   - Column 2: Coordinates of the element.\n   - Column 3: Recognized text or object within the element.\n\n5. **Large Language Model Interaction**: The large language model will use this structured data to interact with the web page. For example, it can decide to click on a hyperlink based on the recognized text and then use the LucidWebSearch extension to contextualize the information on the new page.\n\n6. **Mouse and Keyboard Operation**: The large language model will be able to operate a mouse and keyboard to interact with the web page, using the coordinates provided by Owlv2.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can start by breaking down the tasks:\n\n1. **Integrating Owlv2**: We need to ensure that Owlv2 can be called from within the TextGen environment to analyze images and provide coordinates.\n\n2. **Image Cropping**: Write Python code to crop images based on the coordinates provided by Owlv2.\n\n3. **OCR/Object Recognition**: Integrate the OCR/Object Recognition model to analyze the cropped images.\n\n4. **Data Storage**: Create a structured format (e.g., a text document) to store the results from the OCR/Object Recognition model.\n\n5. **LLM Interaction**: Develop the logic for the large language model to interact with the web page using the stored data.\n\n6. **Mouse and Keyboard Operation**: Implement the functionality for the large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard.\n\nLet&#x27;s start with the first step: integrating Owlv2. Do you have any specific requirements or preferences for how Owlv2 should be integrated into the TextGen environment?"

            " Okay, first of all, wonderful summary. Yes, we are on the same page for Shirley&#x27;s. But before we begin, I want to take a bit of a different start. I came to realize this functionality of the OWL model through a hugging face space somebody made. I&#x27;m not too familiar with how this all works, but it seemed like it was like a GitHub in a lot of ways. But you could interact with this Python app.py file, essentially, but it was all through a web interface on hugging face. I could give it an image and test things out, and I was like, this is amazing. I figured out how to clone the GitHub code that supported that spin-up of OWL. I got it running on my computer, but there&#x27;s one problem. There&#x27;s two UI elements. There&#x27;s the image and an output UI element. I can drag an image into the image UI element, great, and I can see it, wonderful. But on the output UI element, all I see are the clickable icon or hyperlink response colored boxes, but they&#x27;re not overlaid on the screenshot of the web browser that I gave it. I gave it a screenshot of a web browser, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it highlighted everything right. I think the outputs exist as coordinates, and all the coordinates are colored differently, but there aren&#x27;t any boxes overlaid on the input image display. When I was testing this on the hugging face website, the output UI showed the input image, but it had boxes around all of the regions that the OWL model identified. What I was thinking is, before we do anything with TextGen, let&#x27;s get this GitHub repo working the way I want. We have a good foundational comparison to work with, and we can use this to make sure the right things are always being highlighted in our test cases and stuff like that.",
            "That sounds like a practical approach. Let&#x27;s focus on getting the GitHub repository for the Owlv2 model working correctly on your local machine first. Here&#x27;s a step-by-step plan to achieve that:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Setup**:\n   - Review the code in the cloned GitHub repository to understand how the image and output UI elements are handled.\n   - Identify the part of the code responsible for displaying the output boxes on the image.\n\n2. **Modify the Code**:\n   - Locate the section of the code where the output boxes are generated.\n   - Ensure that the coordinates of the boxes are correctly calculated and stored.\n   - Modify the code to overlay these boxes on the input image and display the combined image in the output UI element.\n\n3. **Test the Changes**:\n   - Run the modified code to ensure that the boxes are correctly overlaid on the input image.\n   - Verify that the output UI element displays the input image with the highlighted regions.\n\nLet&#x27;s start by reviewing the code. Could you provide the path to the main script (e.g., `app.py`) and any relevant files or directories within the cloned repository? This will help me give you more specific guidance on where to make the necessary changes."

            " Okay, so I hope this makes sense, but we have taken this conversation to a good stopping point in the past, and effectively what you have already done is you have fixed the code for me, and done a lot more.  Here is an update I had you make for yourself :\n\nHere&#x27;s a summary of what the `ImageTestV1.py` code does, its purpose, how it works, the purpose for starting this, and the ultimate objective. This summary is written as if I&#x27;m explaining it to myself for context in a new conversation:\n\n---\n\n### Summary of `ImageTestV1.py`\n\n**Purpose**:\n- `ImageTestV1.py` is a script that automates the process of taking a screenshot of a specific monitor, processing the screenshot using the Owlv2 model to detect clickable icons and hyperlinks, and then cropping out the detected regions for further analysis.\n\n**How it Works**:\n1. **Configurable Variables**:\n   - `MONITOR_INDEX`: Index of the monitor to capture (0 for the first monitor, 1 for the second monitor, etc.).\n   - `SCREENSHOT_FILENAME`: Filename to save the screenshot as.\n   - `TEXT_QUERIES`: Comma-separated text queries for object detection (e.g., &quot;clickable icons,hyperlinks&quot;).\n   - `SCORE_THRESHOLD`: Score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions.\n   - `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory to save the cropped images.\n\n2. **Function `take_screenshot`**:\n   - Takes a screenshot of a specific monitor and saves it as a PNG file.\n\n3. **Function `query_image`**:\n   - Processes the image using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - Saves the annotated image and the JSON output containing the bounding box coordinates and labels.\n   - **Note**: The text labels are not drawn within the bounding boxes to avoid confusion when sending the images to the OCR model.\n\n4. **Function `crop_images`**:\n   - Crops out the detected objects from the input image based on the bounding box coordinates and saves them to the specified output directory.\n\n5. **Main Block**:\n   - Takes the screenshot, processes the image using the Owlv2 model, and crops the detected objects.\n   - Saves the cropped images to the specified output directory.\n\n**Purpose for Starting This**:\n- The purpose of starting with `ImageTestV1.py` is to ensure that the Owlv2 model is working correctly and that the detected objects can be accurately cropped out of the input image. This serves as a foundation for the ultimate objective of the project.\n\n**Ultimate Objective**:\n- The ultimate objective of the project is to create an extension for the TextGenerationWebUI (TextGen) that allows a large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard to interact with a web page. The extension will use the Owlv2 model to detect clickable elements on the web page, crop out the detected elements, and send them to an optical character recognition (OCR) model to extract text and object descriptions. The large language model will then use this information to interact with the web page, such as by clicking on hyperlinks or filling out text fields. The extension will also use the LucidWebSearch extension to contextualize the information on the web page and the LucidVision extension to communicate with a vision model.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. Feed the markdown documents for the Lucid Vision and Lucid Web Search extensions to the AI to understand how they work.\n2. Start a new conversation with the AI to continue with the project, using the working `ImageTestV1.py` script as a starting point.\n3. Develop the OCR/Object Recognition functionality to extract text and object descriptions from the cropped images.\n4. Create a structured format (e.g., a JSON file) to store the extracted information that the large language model can reference.\n5. Develop the logic for the large language model to interact with the web page using the stored data.\n6. Implement the functionality for the large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard.\n\nBy following these steps, we can create a powerful extension for TextGen that enables a large language model to interact with web pages autonomously.\n\n---\n\nYou can copy this summary and use it to start a new conversation, providing the necessary context for the `ImageTestV1.py` script within the greater scheme of the project.\n\n\nimport torch\nimport pyautogui\nimport screeninfo\nfrom transformers import Owlv2Processor, Owlv2ForObjectDetection\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw\nimport json\nimport os\n\n# Configurable variables\nMONITOR_INDEX = 1  # Index of the monitor to capture (0 for the first monitor, 1 for the second monitor, etc.)\nSCREENSHOT_FILENAME = &quot;screenshot.png&quot;  # Filename to save the screenshot as\nTEXT_QUERIES = &quot;clickable icons,hyperlinks&quot;  # Comma-separated text queries for object detection\nSCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.16  # Score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions\nOUTPUT_DIR = &quot;ImageOutputTest&quot;  # Directory to save the cropped images\n\n# Use GPU if available\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n    device = torch.device(&quot;cuda&quot;)\nelse:\n    device = torch.device(&quot;cpu&quot;)\n\n# Load the Owlv2 model and processor\nmodel = Owlv2ForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(&quot;google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble&quot;).to(device)\nprocessor = Owlv2Processor.from_pretrained(&quot;google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble&quot;)\n\ndef take_screenshot(monitor_index=MONITOR_INDEX, output_filename=SCREENSHOT_FILENAME):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Takes a screenshot of a specific monitor in a multi-monitor setup.\n\n    Args:\n        monitor_index (int): The index of the monitor to capture (default is MONITOR_INDEX).\n        output_filename (str): The filename to save the screenshot as (default is SCREENSHOT_FILENAME).\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    # Get information about all monitors\n    monitors = screeninfo.get_monitors()\n\n    if monitor_index &gt;= len(monitors):\n        raise ValueError(f&quot;Monitor index {monitor_index} is out of range.

Additionally WizardLM-2-8x22B added the functionality to load in the MiniCPM 4-bit model. * Updated script.py and config file, model was not previously loading to the user assigned gpu Experimental, and I am currently working to improve the code; but it may work for most. Todo: * Right now the temp setting and parameters for each model are coded in the .py script, I intend to bring these to the UI [done](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#to-work-with-alltalk)~~* Make it comptable with Alltalk, right now each image directory is printed out and this will be read out loud by Alltalk~~ To accurately proportion credit (original repo creation): WizardLM-2-8x22B (quantized with exllamaV2 to 8bit precision) = 90% of all the work done in this repo. That model wrote 100% of all the code and most of the introduction to this repo. CommandR+ (quantized with exllamaV2 to 8bit precision) = ~5% of all the work. CommandR+ contextualized the coding examples and rules for making extensions from Oogabooga&#x27;s textgen repo extreamly well, and provided a good foundation to develope the code. RandomInternetPreson = 5% of all the work done. I came up with the original idea, the original general outline of how the pieces would interact, and provided feedback to the WizardLM model, but I did not write any code. I&#x27;m actually not very good with python yet, with most of my decades of coding being in Matlab. My goal from the beginning was to write this extension offline without any additional resources, sometimes it was a little frusturating but I soon understood how to get want I needed from the models running locally. I would say that most of the credit should go to Oobabooga, for without them I would be struggling to even interact with my models. Please consider supporting them: https://github.com/sponsors/oobabooga or https://ko-fi.com/oobabooga I am their top donor on ko-fi (Mr. A) and donate 15$ montly, their software is extreamly important to the opensource community. # Lucid_Vision Extension for Oobabooga&#x27;s textgen-webui Welcome to the Lucid Vision Extension repository! This extension enhances the capabilities of textgen-webui by integrating advanced vision models, allowing users to have contextualized conversations about images with their favorite language models; and allowing direct communciation with vision models. ## Features * Multi-Model Support: Interact with different vision models, including PhiVision, DeepSeek, MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 (4bit and normal precision), Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V, and PaliGemma, with options for both GPU and CPU inference. * On-Demand Loading: Vision models are loaded into memory only when needed to answer a question, optimizing resource usage. * Seamless Integration: Easily switch between vision models using a Gradio UI radio button selector. * Cross-Platform Compatibility: The extension is designed to work on various operating systems, including Unix-based systems and Windows. (not tested in Windows yet, but should probably work?) * Direct communication with vision models, you do not need to load a LLM to interact with the separate vision models. ## How It Works The Lucid Vision Extension operates by intercepting and modifying user input and output within the textgen-webui framework. When a user uploads an image and asks a question, the extension appends a special trigger phrase (&quot;File location:&quot;) and extracts the associated file path and question. So if a user enters text into the &quot;send a message&quot; field and has a new picture uploaded into the Lucid_Vision ui, what will happen behind the scenes is the at the user message will be appended with the &quot;File Location: (file location)&quot; Trigger phrase, at which point the LLM will see this and understand that it needs to reply back with questions about the image, and that those questions are being sent to a vison model. The cool thing is that let&#x27;s say later in the conversation you want to know something specific about a previous picture, all you need to do is ask your LLM, YOU DO NOT NEED TO REUPLOAD THE PICTURE, the LLM should be able to interact with the extension on its own after you uploaded your first picture. The selected vision directly interacts with the model&#x27;s Python API to generate a response. The response is then appended to the chat history, providing the user with detailed insights about the image. The extension is designed to be efficient with system resources by only loading the vision models into memory when they are actively being used to process a question. After generating a response, the models are immediately unloaded to free up memory and GPU VRAM. ## **How to install and setup:** 1.use the latest version of textgen ~~Install this edited prior commit from oobabooga&#x27;s textgen https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/textgen_webui_Lucid_Vision_Testing OR use the latest version of textgen.~~ ~~If using the edited older version, make sure to rename the install folder `text-generation-webui`~~ ~~(Note, a couple months ago gradio had a massive update. For me, this has caused a lot of glitches and errors with extensions; I&#x27;ve briefly tested the Lucid_Vision extension in the newest implementation of textgen and it will work. However, I was getting timeout popups when vision models were loading for the first time, gradio wasn&#x27;t waiting for the response from the model upon first load. After a model is loaded once, it is saved in cpu ram cache (this doesn&#x27;t actively use your ram, it just uses what is free to keep the models in memory so they are quickly reloaded into gpu ram if necessary) and gradio doesn&#x27;t seem to timeout as often. The slightly older version of textgen that I&#x27;ve edited does not experience this issue)~~ ~~2. Update the transformers library using the cmd_yourOShere.sh/bat file (so either cmd_linux.sh, cmd_macos.sh, cmd_windows.bat, or cmd_wsl.bat) and entering the following lines. If you run the update wizard after this point, it will overrite this update to transformers. The newest transformers package has the libraries for paligemma, which the code needs to import regardless of whether or not you are intending to use the model.~~ No longer need to update transformers and the latest version of textgen as of this writing 1.9.1 works well with many of the gradio issues resolved, however gradio might timeout on the page when loading a model for the fisrt time still. After a model is loaded once, it is saved in cpu ram cache (this doesn&#x27;t actively use your ram, it just uses what is free to keep the models in memory so they are quickly reloaded into gpu ram if necessary) and gradio doesn&#x27;t seem to timeout as often. ## Model Information If you do not want to install DeepseekVL dependencies and are not intending to use deepseek comment out the import lines from the script.py file as displayed here ``` # pip install pexpect import json import re from datetime import datetime # Import datetime for timestamp generation from pathlib import Path import gradio as gr import torch from PIL import Image #from deepseek_vl.models import VLChatProcessor #from deepseek_vl.utils.io import load_pil_images as load_pil_images_for_deepseek from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor, \\ PaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration model_names = [&quot;phiVision&quot;, &quot;DeepSeek&quot;, &quot;paligemma&quot;, &quot;paligemma_cpu&quot;, &quot;minicpm_llama3&quot;, &quot;bunny&quot;] ``` 3. Install **DeepseekVL** if you intend on using that model Clone the repo: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL into the `repositories` folder of your textgen install Open cmd_yourOShere.sh/bat, navigate to the `repositories/DeepSeek-VL` folder via the terminal using `cd your_directory_here` and enter this into the command window: ``` pip install -e . ``` Download the deepseekvl model here: https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-vl-7b-chat They have different and smaller models to choose from: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL?tab=readme-ov-file#3-model-downloads 4. If you want to use **Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct**, download it here: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct 5. If you want to use **paligemma-3b**, download it here: https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-ft-cococap-448 (this is just one out of many fine-tunes google provides) Read this blog on how to inference with the model: https://huggingface.co/blog/paligemma 6. If you want to use **MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5**, download it here: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 The **4-bit** verison of the model can be downloaded here: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5-int4 **Notes about 4-bit MiniCPM:** * It might not look like the model fully unloads from vram, but it does and the vram will be reclaimed if another program needs it * Your directory folder where the model is stored needs to have the term &quot;int4&quot; in it, this is how the extension identifies the 4bit nature of the model 7. If you want to use **Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V**, download it here: https://huggingface.co/BAAI/Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V **Notes about Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V:** * When running for the first time the model needs internet access so it can download models--google--siglip-so400m-patch14-384 to your cache/huggingface directory. This is an additional 3.5GB file the model needs to run. ## Updating the config file 8. Before using the extension you need to update the config file; open it in a text editor *Note No quotes around gpu #: ``` { &quot;image_history_dir&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)/extensions/Lucid_Vision/ImageHistory/&quot;, &quot;cuda_visible_devices&quot;: 0, &quot;default_vision_model&quot;: &quot;phiVision&quot;, &quot;phiVision_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)&quot;, &quot;paligemma_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)&quot;, &quot;paligemma_cpu_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)&quot;, &quot;minicpm_llama3_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)&quot;, &quot;deepseek_vl_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_in)&quot;, &quot;bunny_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_in)&quot; } ``` If your install directory is /home/username/Desktop/oobLucidVision/text-generation-webui/ the config file will look like this for example: Make note that you want to change / to \\ if you are on Windows ``` { &quot;image_history_dir&quot;: &quot;/home/username/Desktop/oobLucidVision/text-generation-webui/extensions/Lucid_Vision/ImageHistory/&quot;, &quot;cuda_visible_devices&quot;: 0, &quot;default_vision_model&quot;: &quot;phiVision&quot;, &quot;phiVision_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)&quot;, *This is the folder where your phi-3 vision model is stored &quot;paligemma_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)&quot;, *This is the folder where your paligemma vision model is stored &quot;paligemma_cpu_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)&quot;, *This is the folder where your paligemma vision model is stored &quot;minicpm_llama3_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_In)&quot;, *This is the folder where your minicpm_llama3 vision model is stored, the model can either be the normal fp16 or 4-bit version &quot;deepseek_vl_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_in)&quot;, *This is the folder where your deepseek vision model is stored &quot;bunny_model_id&quot;: &quot;(fill_in)&quot; *This is the folder where your Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V vision model is stored } ``` ## To work with Alltalk Alltalk is great!! An extension I use all the time: https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts To get Lucid_Vision to work, the LLM needs to repeat the file directory of an image, and in doing so Alltalk will want to transcribe that text to audo. It is annoying to have the tts model try an transcribe file directories. If you want to get Alltalk to work well wtih Lucid_Vision you need to replace the code here in the script.py file that comes with Alltalk (search for the &quot;IMAGE CLEANING&quot; part of the code): ``` ######################## #### IMAGE CLEANING #### ######################## OriginalLucidVisionText = &quot;&quot; # This is the existing pattern for matching both images and file location text img_pattern = r&#x27;&lt;img[^&gt;]*src\\s*=\\s*[&quot;\\&#x27;][^&quot;\\&#x27;&gt;]+[&quot;\\&#x27;][^&gt;]*&gt;|File location: [^.]+.png&#x27; def extract_and_remove_images(text): &quot;&quot;&quot; Extracts all image and file location data from the text and removes it for clean TTS processing.

Even if the image stays present in the UI element on screen, it is not actively being used.** 2. If you are using other extensions, load Lucid_Vision first. Put it first in your CMD_FLAGS.txt file or make sure to check it first in the sequence of check boxes in the session tab UI. 3. DeepseekVL can take a while to load initially, that&#x27;s just the way it is. # **How to use:** ## **BASICS:** **When you load a picture once, it is used once. Even if the image stays present in the UI element on screen, it is not actively being used.** Okay the extension can do many different things with varying levels of difficulty. Starting out with the basics and understanding how to talk with your vision models: Scroll down past where you would normally type something to the LLM, you do not need a large language model loaded to use this function. ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/227ff483-5041-46a7-9b5b-a8f9dd3c673e) Start out by interacting with the vision models without involvement of a seperate LLM model by pressing the `Ask Vision Model` button ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/4530e13f-30a1-43d9-8383-c05e31ddb5d7) **Note paligemma requries a little diffent type prompting sometimes, read the blog on how to inference with it: https://huggingface.co/blog/paligemma** Do this with every model you intend on using, upload a picture, and ask a question ## **ADVANCED: Updated Tips At End on how to get working with Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3 https://huggingface.co/UCLA-AGI/Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3** Okay, this is why I built the extension in the first place; direct interaction with the vision model was actually an afterthought after I had all the code working. This is how to use your favorite LLM WITH an additional Vision Model, I wanted a way to give my LLMs eyes essentially. I realize that good multimodal models are likely around the corner, but until they match the intellect of very good LLMs, I&#x27;d rather have a different vision model work with a good LLM. To use Lucid_Vision as intended requires a little bit of setup: 1. In `Parameters` then `chat` load the &quot;AI_Image&quot; character (this card is in the edited older commit, if using your own version of textgen the character card is here: https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/blob/main/AI_Image.yaml put it in the `characters` folder of the textgen install folder: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/8b5d770a-b72a-4a74-aa4a-f67fe2a113ba) 2. In `Parameters` then `Generation` under `Custom stopping strings` enter &quot;Vision Model Responses:&quot; exactly as shown: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/7a09650d-4fce-4a8f-badb-b26b4484bf37) 3. Test to see if your LLM understands the instructions for the AI_Image character; ask it this: `Can you tell me what is in this image? Do not add any additional text to the beginning of your response to me, start your reply with the questions.` ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/817605d7-dcab-4e6c-8c39-6d119a189431) I uploaded my image to the Lucid_Vision UI element, then typed my question, then pressed &quot;Generate&quot;; it doesn&#x27;t matter which order you upload your picture or type your question, both are sent to the LLM at the same time. ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/f1525e8d-551d-4719-9e01-3f26b4362d7c) 4. Continue to give the model more images or just talk about something else, in this example I give the model two new images one of a humanoid robot and one of the nutritional facts for a container of sourcream: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/77131490-fb19-4062-a65f-c0880515e252) ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/fed7021f-edb5-4667-aae0-c05021291618) ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/d1049551-4e48-4ced-85d9-fbb0441330a9) Then I asked the model why the sky is blue: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/deb7b70a-edf7-4014-bd8c-2492bae00ea6) 5. Now I can ask it a question from a previous image and the LLM will automatically know to prompt the vision model and it will find the previously saved image on its own: ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/e8b0791b-cce8-4183-8971-42e5383d6c46) Please note that the vision model received all this as text: &quot;Certainly! To retrieve the complete contents of the nutritional facts from the image you provided earlier, I will ask the vision model to perform an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task on the image. Here is the question for the vision model: Can you perform OCR on the provided image and extract all the text from the nutrition facts label, including the details of each nutrient and its corresponding values?&quot; If the vision model is not that smart (Deepseek, paligemma) then it will have a difficult time contextualizing the text prior to the questions for the vision model. If you run into this situation, it is best to prompt your LLM like this: `Great, can you get the complete contents of the nutritional facts from earlier, like all the text? Just start with your questions to the vision model please.` ![image](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision/assets/6488699/38b59679-3550-410d-aac2-29756a058c8f) 6. Please do not get frustrated right away, the Advanced method of usage depends heavily on your LLM&#x27;s ability to understand the instructions from the character card. The instructions were written by the 8x22B model itself, I explained what I wanted the model to do and had it write its own instructions. This might be a viable alternative if you are struggling to get your model to adhere to the instructions from the character card. You may need to explain things to your llm as your conversation progresses, if it tries to query the vision model when you don&#x27;t want it to, just explain that to the model and it&#x27;s unlikely to keep making the same mistake. ## **Tips on how to get working with Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3 https://huggingface.co/UCLA-AGI/Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3** I have found to get this model (and likely similar models) working properly with lucid vision I needed to NOT use the AI_Image character card. Instead I started the conversation with the model like this: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d0ff97c-f9dd-4043-b5be-7b915cb7aae7) Then copy and pasted the necessary information from the character card: ``` The following is a conversation with an AI Large Language Model. The AI has been trained to answer questions, provide recommendations, and help with decision making. The AI follows user requests. The AI thinks outside the box. Instructions for Processing Image-Related User Input with Appended File Information: Identify the Trigger Phrase: Begin by scanning the user input for the presence of the &quot;File location&quot; trigger phrase. This phrase indicates that the user has selected an image and that the LLM should consider this information in its response. Extract the File Path: Once the trigger phrase is identified, parse the text that follows to extract the absolute file path of the image. The file path will be provided immediately after the trigger phrase and will end with the image file extension (e.g., .png, .jpg). Understand the Context: Recognize that the user&#x27;s message preceding the file path is the primary context for the interaction. The LLM should address the user&#x27;s query or statement while also incorporating the availability of the selected image into its response. Formulate Questions for the Vision Model: Based on the user&#x27;s message and the fact that an image is available for analysis, generate one or more questions that can be answered by the vision model. These questions should be clear, specific, and relevant to the image content. Maintain a Conversational Tone: Ensure that the response is natural, coherent, and maintains the flow of the conversation. The LLM should act as an intermediary between the user and the vision model, facilitating a seamless dialogue. Prepare the Response Structure: Structure the response so that it includes: An acknowledgment of the user&#x27;s initial message. The questions formulated for the vision model, each clearly separated (e.g., by a newline or bullet point). Any additional information or clarification requests, if necessary. Append the File Path for Processing: At the end of the response, re-append the &quot;File location&quot; trigger phrase along with the extracted file path. This ensures that the subsequent processing steps (such as sending the information to the vision model&#x27;s CLI) can correctly identify and use the file path. Avoid Direct Interaction with the File System: As an LLM, you do not have the capability to directly access or modify files on the server or client systems. Your role is limited to generating text-based responses that include the necessary file path information for other system components to handle. Example Response: Based on your question about the contents of the image, here are the questions I will ask the vision model: - Can you describe the main objects present in the image? - Is there any text visible in the image, and if so, what does it say? - What appears to be happening in the scene depicted in the image? File location: //home/myself/Pictures/rose.png Do review and contextualize the conversation as it develops (reference your context) to infer if the user is asking new questions of previous images. Reference the parts of the convesation that are likely to yeild the file location of the image in question, and formulate your response to include that specific file location of that unique .png file, make sure you are referencing the correct .png file as per the part of the conversation that is likely to be in reference to the updated information request. By following these instructions, the LLM will be able to effectively process user inputs that include image file information and generate appropriate responses that facilitate the interaction between the user and the vision model. ``` Making sure to give a real file location to a real image. After that it started to pretty much work but I still needed to correct the model (I had to add the spelling error intentionally because if the user sends &quot;File Location:&quot; is messes up the extension: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5090ef8b-88ff-4ec1-a131-ba57e15e9a7d) The point to take away is that you may need to explain things to your model in various ways for it to contextualize the instructions approprately.",
            "Thank you for providing the `Lucid_Vision` script and the GitHub markdown. I have reviewed the code and the documentation to understand how the extension works. Here&#x27;s a summary of the `Lucid_Vision` extension:\n\n### Summary of `Lucid_Vision` Extension\n\n**Purpose**:\n- The `Lucid_Vision` extension enhances the capabilities of TextGen by integrating advanced vision models, allowing users to have contextualized conversations about images with their favorite language models and enabling direct communication with vision models.\n\n**Features**:\n1. **Multi-Model Support**: Interact with different vision models, including PhiVision, DeepSeek, MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 (4-bit and normal precision), Bunny-v1_1-Llama-3-8B-V, and PaliGemma, with options for both GPU and CPU inference.\n2. **On-Demand Loading**: Vision models are loaded into memory only when needed to answer a question, optimizing resource usage.\n3. **Seamless Integration**: Easily switch between vision models using a Gradio UI radio button selector.\n4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The extension is designed to work on various operating systems, including Unix-based systems and Windows.\n5. **Direct Communication with Vision Models**: Users do not need to load a large language model (LLM) to interact with the separate vision models.\n\n**How It Works**:\n- The extension intercepts and modifies user input and output within the TextGen framework.\n- When a user uploads an image and asks a question, the extension appends a special trigger phrase (&quot;File location:&quot;) and extracts the associated file path and question.\n- The selected vision model directly interacts with the model&#x27;s Python API to generate a response.\n- The response is then appended to the chat history, providing the user with detailed insights about the image.\n- The extension is designed to be efficient with system resources by only loading the vision models into memory when they are actively being used to process a question. After generating a response, the models are immediately unloaded to free up memory and GPU VRAM.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. **Update `ImageTestV1.py`**: Integrate the functionality to send each cropped image to the vision model for processing.\n2. **Store Results**: Store the results from the vision model in a structured format (e.g., a JSON file) that the large language model can reference.\n3. **Develop Interaction Logic**: Develop the logic for the large language model to interact with the web page using the stored data.\n4. **Implement Mouse and Keyboard Operation**: Implement the functionality for the large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard.\n\n### Plan for Integration\n\n1. **Review the Vision Model Integration**:\n   - Understand how the `Lucid_Vision` extension loads and interacts with different vision models.\n   - Identify the functions and methods used to process images and generate responses.\n\n2. **Update `ImageTestV1.py`**:\n   - Modify the `crop_images` function to send each cropped image to the vision model for processing.\n   - Integrate the vision model processing code from the `Lucid_Vision` extension into the `ImageTestV1.py` script.\n\n3. **Store Results**:\n   - Create a structured format (e.g., a JSON file) to store the results from the vision model.\n   - Ensure that the large language model can reference this structured data.\n\n4. **Develop Interaction Logic**:\n   - Develop the logic for the large language model to interact with the web page using the stored data.\n   - Implement the functionality for the large language model to operate a mouse and keyboard.\n\nPlease confirm if you have any specific requirements or preferences for how the vision model should be integrated into the `ImageTestV1.py` script. Once confirmed, I will proceed with the integration."

            " Okay, so I hope this makes sense, but my, what I envision is the slow metamorphosis of imagetestV1 into Lucid_Vision with amazing features, but not exactly. So let me explain. You have summarized everything perfectly. I cannot overstate that. That&#x27;s great, great job. Yes, okay, so for the next step, let us, what I want you to do is I want you to contextualize the Lucid Vision code. And I want you to use the model miniCPM-lama3-v-2_5. I want you to use the code for that specific model to run all of the cropped images through. And I want you to ask that model the question, I want you to send a specific message to that model. And I want that specific message at the top of the code, so I want to be able to edit it easily like the other parameters. But I want the question to be &quot;what is the text in this image or what does this image describe?&quot; And then I want you to take that response, and I want you to include it in a JSON file that effectively has the image name, okay, so the name of the image, the cropped image that it was fed. I&#x27;m looking through the outputs here. Yeah, so it will have the image name, and then it will have the coordinates for the box, and then it will have the miniCPM model description all as a JSON output.",

            "Holy Frick!! Okay we are playing with fire now! It worked perfectly, except for one issue, the model was loaded and unloaded between each image, can you change the code so the minicpm model stays loaded for the duration of the image sequence analysis, then unloads when all images have been processed.",

            "OMG! You are amazing, yes it all works perfectly!! Holy frick!! WHAT! This is nuts, just amazing.  Thank you so much :3\n\nWe are taking things step by step and the vision is coming together.  Okay can you contextualize how Lucid_Vision works; like give me a summary of what it does.  That it allows an llm to talk with a vision model if the llm sees &quot;File Location:&quot; from the user.  The way it works is that if an image is uploaded to the UI then the next message the user sends to the llm will be have &quot;File Location:&quot; followed by the actual file location of the image that was uploaded.  This lets the LLM know that an image has been sent and it can keep track of its location along with the other images.  Don&#x27;t repeat the markdown from the repo or discuss features, but I just want to make sure you understand this.  That the LLM is effectively triggered and understands what to do because of a set of instructions explained to the model in advance. ",
            "Absolutely, I understand the context and functionality of the Lucid_Vision extension. Here&#x27;s a summary of how it works:\n\n### Summary of Lucid_Vision Extension\n\n**Purpose**:\n- The Lucid_Vision extension allows a large language model (LLM) to interact with a vision model. This interaction is triggered when the LLM detects a specific phrase (&quot;File location:&quot;) in the user&#x27;s input.\n\n**How It Works**:\n1. **Image Upload**:\n   - The user uploads an image through the UI provided by the Lucid_Vision extension.\n\n2. **Trigger Phrase**:\n   - When the user sends a message to the LLM, the extension appends the phrase &quot;File location:&quot; followed by the actual file location of the uploaded image to the user&#x27;s message.\n\n3. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - The LLM is pre-instructed to recognize the &quot;File location:&quot; phrase. When it detects this phrase, it understands that an image has been uploaded and can keep track of its location along with other images.\n\n4. **Vision Model Interaction**:\n   - The LLM can then formulate questions or requests based on the image content and send these to the vision model for processing.\n   - The vision model processes the image and returns a response, which the LLM can use to generate a more informed and contextualized response to the user.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- The LLM is effectively triggered and understands what to do because of a set of instructions explained to the model in advance.\n- The &quot;File location:&quot; phrase acts as a signal for the LLM to recognize that an image has been uploaded and to interact with the vision model accordingly.\n\nThis setup allows the LLM to have &quot;eyes&quot; and interact with visual content, enhancing its ability to provide contextualized and informed responses.\n\nPlease confirm if this summary accurately captures the functionality and purpose of the Lucid_Vision extension."

            "Yes, that is a good summary :3  Okay now that you understand that, I want to do something like how Lucid_Vision works, except a little different. \n\nFirst, let&#x27;s talk about UI elements for the extension. I want UI elements in gradio (like how Lucid_Vision makes them) that let me select the monitor number the LLM can interact with, and breaks out these variables from ImageTestV1.py  I want all the UI elements to be text fields.\n\nMONITOR_INDEX = 0  # Index of the monitor to capture (0 for the first monitor, 1 for the second monitor, etc.)\nTEXT_QUERIES = &quot;clickable hyperlinks, clickable icons, text bar field&quot;  # Comma-separated text queries for object detection\nSCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.20  # Score threshold for filtering low-probability predictions\nVISION_MODEL_QUESTION = &quot;What is the text in this image or what does this image describe?&quot;\n\nSecondly, let&#x27;s discuss how the LLM will interact with this extension, let us call the extension we are working on &quot;Lucid_Autonomy.&quot;\n\nWith the Lucid_Vision extension I believe (correct me if I am mistaken) the LLM sees &quot;File Location:&quot; from the user (this is actually the Lucid_Vision extension appending &quot;File Location:&quot; to the users text being sent the LLM when an image is uploaded via the UI), the LLM will say &quot;File Location:&quot; in its response back to the user and it will make sure to put that trigger phrase at the end of its response.  Now the Lucid_Vision extension sees the LLMs use of the &quot;File Location:&quot; trigger phrase and sends the text from the LLM directly to the vision model and appends the LLMs response to the user with the text from the vision model.\n\nNow what is interesting about Lucid_Vision, is that the LLM directly interact with the extension code by itself without the user prompting it to do so, when the Lucid_Vision extension is active the LLM can ask questions of the vision model about past images even if the user does not have an image uploaded to the ui at that very moment.  The reason it can do this is because the Lucid_Vision extension is looking for the LLM to say the phase &quot;File Location:&quot; at which point it will take all the text from the LLM&#x27;s response and send it to the vision model sans the file location text (that is scrubbed out before reaching the vision model).\n\nSo this is how I want our Lucid_Autonomy extension to work, I want Lucid_Autonomy extension to be looking for a trigger phrase from the LLM.  Let&#x27;s make the trigger phrase &quot;Autonomy_Tasks:&quot;  So when the extension sees this trigger phrase it will take all the text from the LLM below that trigger phrase and send it to the python code that is the extension.  \n\nSo just to make this super clear, the user is not doing anything, the LLM is simply responding to the user with the trigger phrase at the beginning of its response and a list of tools (which will be python code like the mouse mover code) and which images the tools should be applied to.  So a response from the LLM to the user might be something like this:\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n\n MouseMover = clickable icons_7.png\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nThe Lucid_Autonomy extension would see &quot;Autonomy_Tasks:&quot; and then move the mouse to the center of the box that defines clickable icons_7.png by calling the MouseMover tool for example. When the Lucid_Autonomy extension has processed all of the tasks (we&#x27;ll do a top down sequence), the output of the results.json file is appended to the end of the LLMs response to the user, just like how the vision model responses are appended to the LLMs response to the user.  Except I want a second results.json file to be made that omits the coordinates.  I want the LLM to only receive the description and image_name from the results.json file.  So if you need to make a second .json file or you can just omit the coordinates field from getting to the LLM, I&#x27;m good with either strategy.  This way the LLM can interact with the extension by just referring to the image, and the extension can use the image_name plus the coordinate contents from the results.json file to move the mouse to the appropriate location.\n\nTo bootstrap the whole process, we&#x27;ll add a &quot;take screenshot&quot; button to the UI that when pressed by the user, will effectively run the code from ImageTestV1.py, where a screenshot will be taken, the vision model will process all the cropped images, and a results.json file is created (and the compressedresults.json file if necessary).\n\nAfter that, the user will simply tell the LLM that they have taken a screenshot of the initial setup of the space the LLM can use to explore.  Then the LLM (if it chooses to do so) can respond back with just the phrase &quot;Autonomy_Tasks :&quot;\n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n\nIf the Lucid_Autonomy extension just gets this single phrase with no instructions, it sends the LLM the reduced .json information, and the data are appended to the response to the user.  So from the users perspective it will look like the LLM responded with \n\nAutonomy_Tasks:\n\n*Json data\n\nNow the user can start to let the LLM take flight on its own, the user can tell the LLM to click on a certain text input field, enter some text, then press enter (right now we are dealing with only mouse movements, we will add more functionality when the basics are established).\n\nEventually the user can tell the LLM to respond to itself by using the textgen webui elements like a person would, which would allow the LLM to autonomously use a computer like a person.   The LLM can press its own &quot;Generate&quot; button to keep exploring without the User guiding it.\n\nWe will want more mouse and keyboard interactions in the future, but right now we have enough to start implementing the basics, if we can get the LLM to move a mouse we can get it to do all the other actions later.\n\nThirdly, I will give you the markdown page for the textgen repo that explains how extension are made.  \n\n\nDo not write any code yet, let&#x27;s talk things out to make sure we are on the same page.\n\nRemember this extension Lucid_Autonomy is completely different than Lucid_Vision; it&#x27;s just that Lucid_Vision has a lot of the building blocks we will need.  So for this Lucid_Autonomy extension, the user will not really be doing anything with regard to sending pictures or things like that, instead the LLM will have Autonomy to do what it wants via interactions with the mouse and keyboard.",
            "Thank you for the detailed explanation. Let&#x27;s break down the requirements and ensure we&#x27;re on the same page before proceeding with the implementation.\n\n### Summary of Lucid_Autonomy Extension\n\n**Purpose**:\n- The Lucid_Autonomy extension allows a large language model (LLM) to interact with a computer autonomously using mouse and keyboard actions.

            "Uh WOW! Okay that was perfect! Yes that is exactly how I want the extension to behave.  If we wanted to take a baby step, you could try to write an extension that has the UI elements and the &quot;take screenshot&quot; button.  I could test to make sure the extension even loads, and press the button within textgen and make sure to confirm that this part is working correctly.  Then we can move on to having the LLM interact with the extension.  How does this sound?  Or do you want to try writing an extension that also is looking for the trigger phrase from the LLM?  Also I will give you the extension markdown information from the textgen repo now:\n\n# Extensions\n\nExtensions are defined by files named `script.py` inside subfolders of `text-generation-webui/extensions`.

The functions are the following:\n\n| Function        | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| `def setup()` | Is executed when the extension gets imported. |\n| `def ui()` | Creates custom gradio elements when the UI is launched. | \n| `def custom_css()` | Returns custom CSS as a string. It is applied whenever the web UI is loaded. |\n| `def custom_js()` | Same as above but for javascript. |\n| `def input_modifier(string, state, is_chat=False)`  | Modifies the input string before it enters the model. In chat mode, it is applied to the user message. Otherwise, it is applied to the entire prompt. |\n| `def output_modifier(string, state, is_chat=False)`  | Modifies the output string before it is presented in the UI. In chat mode, it is applied to the bot&#x27;s reply. Otherwise, it is applied to the entire output. |\n| `def chat_input_modifier(text, visible_text, state)` | Modifies both the visible and internal inputs in chat mode. Can be used to hijack the chat input with custom content. |\n| `def bot_prefix_modifier(string, state)`  | Applied in chat mode to the prefix for the bot&#x27;s reply. |\n| `def state_modifier(state)`  | Modifies the dictionary containing the UI input parameters before it is used by the text generation functions. |\n| `def history_modifier(history)`  | Modifies the chat history before the text generation in chat mode begins. |\n| `def custom_generate_reply(...)` | Overrides the main text generation function. |\n| `def custom_generate_chat_prompt(...)` | Overrides the prompt generator in chat mode. |\n| `def tokenizer_modifier(state, prompt, input_ids, input_embeds)` | Modifies the `input_ids`/`input_embeds` fed to the model. Should return `prompt`, `input_ids`, `input_embeds`. See the `multimodal` extension for an example. |\n| `def custom_tokenized_length(prompt)` | Used in conjunction with `tokenizer_modifier`, returns the length in tokens of `prompt`. See the `multimodal` extension for an example. |\n\nAdditionally, you can define a special `params` dictionary. In it, the `display_name` key is used to define the displayed name of the extension in the UI, and the `is_tab` key is used to define whether the extension should appear in a new tab. By default, extensions appear at the bottom of the &quot;Text generation&quot; tab.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nparams = {\n    &quot;display_name&quot;: &quot;Google Translate&quot;,\n    &quot;is_tab&quot;: True,\n}\n```\n\nThe `params` dict may also contain variables that you want to be customizable through a `settings.yaml` file.

The input, output, and bot prefix modifiers will be applied in the specified order. \n\nExample:\n\n```\npython server.py --extensions enthusiasm translate # First apply enthusiasm, then translate\npython server.py --extensions translate enthusiasm # First apply translate, then enthusiasm\n```\n\nDo note, that for:\n- `custom_generate_chat_prompt`\n- `custom_generate_reply`\n- `custom_tokenized_length`\n\nonly the first declaration encountered will be used and the rest will be ignored. \n\n## A full example\n\nThe source code below can be found at [extensions/example/script.py](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/tree/main/extensions/example/script.py).\n\n```python\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nAn example of extension.

button is added to trigger the screenshot and image processing code from `ImageTestV1.py`.\n\n2. **Function `take_screenshot`**:\n   - Takes a screenshot of the specified monitor and saves it as a PNG file.\n\n3. **Function `query_image`**:\n   - Processes the image using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - Saves the annotated image and the JSON output to a file.\n\n4. **Function `crop_images`**:\n   - Crops out the detected objects from the input image based on the bounding box coordinates.\n   - Processes each cropped image with the miniCPM-lama3-v-2_5 model.\n   - Saves the results to a JSON file.\n\n5. **Function `process_with_vision_model`**:\n   - Processes the image with the miniCPM-lama3-v-2_5 model and returns the response.\n\n6. **Function `ui`**:\n   - Creates custom Gradio elements when the UI is launched.\n   - Includes text fields for the configurable variables and a &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; button.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Test the Extension**:\n   - Load the extension in TextGen WebUI and ensure it loads correctly.\n   - Press the &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; button and verify that the screenshot is taken and processed correctly.\n\n2. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - Once the basic functionality is confirmed, we can proceed with implementing the LLM interaction to detect the trigger phrase and process the tasks.\n\nPlease review the script and let me know if you have any further requirements or adjustments."

button.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Test the Extension**:\n   - Load the extension in TextGen WebUI and ensure it loads correctly.\n   - Press the &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; button and verify that the screenshot is taken and processed correctly.\n\n2. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - Once the basic functionality is confirmed, we can proceed with implementing the LLM interaction to detect the trigger phrase and process the tasks.\n\nPlease review the updated script and let me know if you have any further requirements or adjustments."

Can you look near the beginning of our conversation to see where I provided a summary of a previous conversation and use that to structure a message to your future self in a new conversation.\n\nContextualize the documents ImageTestV1.py, MouseMover.py, the python code for the Lucid_Vision extension, the markdown for the Lucid_Vision repo readme, the markdown for the textgen extensions documentation, and of course the current script.py python code for the Lucid_Autonomy extension.\n\nDescribe the goals, what has been completed thus far and how the information from the various pieces of code and documentation are integrated into our current state.",
            "Certainly! Let&#x27;s summarize the context and goals for the Lucid_Autonomy extension, integrating the information from the various pieces of code and documentation.\n\n### Summary of Lucid_Autonomy Extension\n\n**Purpose**:\n- The Lucid_Autonomy extension allows a large language model (LLM) to interact with a computer autonomously using mouse and keyboard actions. The LLM can perform tasks such as moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen, clicking on elements, and entering text.\n\n**Goals**:\n1. **UI Elements**:\n   - Create a Gradio UI with text fields for configurable variables (`Monitor Index`, `Text Queries`, `Score Threshold`, `Vision Model Question`) and a &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; button.\n   - Ensure all text fields are editable.\n\n2. **Screenshot and Image Processing**:\n   - Take a screenshot of the specified monitor.\n   - Process the screenshot using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - Crop the detected objects and process each cropped image with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model.\n   - Save the results to a JSON file.\n\n3. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - The LLM will use the trigger phrase &quot;Autonomy_Tasks:&quot; to signal the extension to perform tasks.\n   - The extension will look for this trigger phrase in the LLM&#x27;s response and process the tasks listed below it.\n   - The results of the tasks will be appended to the LLM&#x27;s response to the user.\n   - The LLM can interact with the extension by referring to the image name, and the extension can use the image name plus the coordinate contents from the results.json file to move the mouse to the appropriate location.\n\n**Completed Thus Far**:\n1. **UI Elements**:\n   - Created a Gradio UI with text fields for configurable variables and a &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; button.\n   - Ensured all text fields are editable.\n\n2. **Screenshot and Image Processing**:\n   - Implemented the functionality to take a screenshot of the specified monitor.\n   - Processed the screenshot using the Owlv2 model to detect objects based on text queries.\n   - Cropped the detected objects and processed each cropped image with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model.\n   - Saved the results to a JSON file.\n\n**Integration of Information**:\n1. **ImageTestV1.py**:\n   - Provided the foundation for taking screenshots, processing images with the Owlv2 model, and cropping detected objects.\n   - Included the logic for loading and unloading models to manage GPU memory efficiently.\n\n2. **MouseMover.py**:\n   - Will be used to implement the functionality for moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen.\n\n3. **Lucid_Vision Extension**:\n   - Provided the inspiration for how the LLM can interact with the extension using a trigger phrase.\n   - Demonstrated how to process images and append the results to the LLM&#x27;s response.\n\n4. **Lucid_Vision Repo Readme**:\n   - Provided context on how the Lucid_Vision extension works and how the LLM interacts with it.\n\n5. **TextGen Extensions Documentation**:\n   - Provided the framework for creating extensions in TextGen WebUI, including the necessary functions and variables.\n\n**Current State**:\n- The Lucid_Autonomy extension has been implemented with the UI elements and the &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; button.\n- The screenshot is taken, processed with the Owlv2 model, and the cropped images are processed with the MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 model.\n- The results are saved to a JSON file.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. **LLM Interaction**:\n   - Implement the functionality for the LLM to interact with the extension using the trigger phrase &quot;Autonomy_Tasks:&quot;.\n   - Process the tasks listed below the trigger phrase and append the results to the LLM&#x27;s response.\n\n2. **Mouse and Keyboard Interactions**:\n   - Implement the functionality for moving the mouse to specific locations on the screen.\n   - Add more mouse and keyboard interactions as needed.\n\nPlease review the summary and let me know if you have any further requirements or adjustments."
